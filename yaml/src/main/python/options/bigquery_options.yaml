          How to specify if a write should append to an existing table, replace
          the table, or verify that the table is empty. Note that the my_dataset
          being written to must already exist. Unbounded collections can only
          be written using 'WRITE_EMPTY' or 'WRITE_APPEND'.

          Number of streams defines the parallelism of the BigQueryIO’s Write 
          transform and roughly corresponds to the number of Storage Write API’s 
          streams which will be used by the pipeline. See
          https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/streaming-data-into-bigquery-using-storage-write-api
          for the recommended values. The default value is 1.
