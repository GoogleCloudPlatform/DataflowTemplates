# Code Owners

Dataflow Templates uses [Code Owners](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
to manage code review. This means that for some PRs, reviewers will be automatically assigned.
Code Owners are configured from the [CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS) file.

The goal is for this to eventually be fully automated, it is not yet, however,
for certain directories. If you create a PR and a reviewer is not assigned
within 1 business day, please tag `@GoogleCloudPlatform/dataflow-templates-wg`
on your PR to get a reviewer assigned.
