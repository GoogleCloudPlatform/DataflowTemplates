      An optional description. Provide this property when creating the disk.
    type: string
  diskName:
    description: |-
      Specifies the disk name. If not specified, the default is to use the name
      of the instance. If the disk with the instance name exists already in the
      given zone/region, a new name will be automatically generated.
    type: string
  diskSizeGb:
    description: |-
      Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB. If not specified, the disk
      will be the same size as the image (usually 10GB). If specified, the size
      must be equal to or larger than 10GB.
    type: string
  diskType:
    description: |-
      Specifies the disk type to use to create the instance. If not specified,
      the default is pd-standard, specified using the full URL. For

  guestOsFeatures:
    description: |-
      A list of features to enable on the guest operating system. Applicable
      only for bootable images. Read  Enabling guest operating system features
      to see a list of available options.  Guest OS features are applied by
      merging initializeParams.guestOsFeatures and disks.guestOsFeatures
    type: array

      $ref: GuestOsFeature.yaml
  labels:
    description: |-
      Labels to apply to this disk. These can be later modified by the
      disks.setLabels method. This field is only applicable for persistent
      disks.

  resourcePolicies:
    description: |-
      Resource policies applied to this disk for automatic snapshot
      creations. Specified using the full or partial URL. For instance
      template, specify only the resource policy name.

      type: string
  sourceImage:
    description: |-
      The source image to create this disk. When creating a new
      instance, one of initializeParams.sourceImage or
      initializeParams.sourceSnapshot or disks.source is required
      except for local SSD.  To create a disk with one of the public
      operating system images, specify the image by its family name.
      For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian
      9 image: projects/debian- cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
      Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating
      system image: projects/debian- cloud/global/images/debian-9
      -stretch-vYYYYMMDD   To create a disk with a custom image that
      you created, specify the image name in the following
    type: string
  sourceImageEncryptionKey:
    description: |-
      The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image.
      Required if the source image is protected by a customer-
      supplied encryption key.  Instance templates do not store
      customer- supplied encryption keys, so you cannot create disks
      for instances in a managed instance group if the source images
      are encrypted with your own keys.
    $ref: CustomerEncryptionKey.yaml
  sourceSnapshot:
    description: |-
      The source snapshot to create this disk. When creating a new
      instance, one of initializeParams.sourceSnapshot or
      initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is required
      except for local SSD.  To create a disk with a snapshot that
      you created, specify the snapshot name in the following
      format: global/snapshots/my-backup If the source snapshot is
      deleted later, this field will not be set.
    type: string
  sourceSnapshotEncryptionKey:
    description: |-
      The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot.
