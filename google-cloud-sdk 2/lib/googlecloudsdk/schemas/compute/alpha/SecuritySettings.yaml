  clientTlsPolicy:
    description: |-
      A URL referring to a networksecurity.ClientTlsPolicy resource that
      describes how clients should authenticate with this service's backends.
      clientTlsPolicy only applies to a global BackendService with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If left blank,
      communications are not encrypted.

    $ref: ClientTlsSettings.yaml
  subjectAltNames:
    description: |-
      A list of Subject Alternative Names (SANs) that the client verifies during
      a mutual TLS handshake with an server/endpoint for this BackendService.
      When the server presents its X.509 certificate to the client, the client
      inspects the certificate's subjectAltName field. If the field contains one
      of the specified values, the communication continues. Otherwise, it fails.
      This additional check enables the client to verify that the server is
      authorized to run the requested service. Note that the contents of the
      server certificate's subjectAltName field are configured by the Public Key
      Infrastructure which provisions server identities. Only applies to a
      global BackendService with loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. Only applies when BackendService has an attached
      clientTlsPolicy with clientCertificate (mTLS mode).
