      [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetGrpcProxy for
      target grpc proxies.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created.
      The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.

      If true, indicates that the BackendServices referenced by the urlMap may
      be accessed by gRPC applications without using a sidecar proxy. This will
      enable configuration checks on urlMap and its referenced BackendServices
      to not allow unsupported features. A gRPC application must use "xds-
      experimental:///" scheme in the target URI of the service it is connecting
      to. If false, indicates that the BackendServices referenced by the urlMap
      will be accessed by gRPC applications via a sidecar proxy. In this case, a
      gRPC application must not use "xds-experimental:///" scheme in the target
      URI of the service it is connecting to
