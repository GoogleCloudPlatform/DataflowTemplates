  IPAddress:
    description: |-
      IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends traffic
      to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the target
      that you specify in the forwarding rule.  If you don't specify a reserved
      IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned. Methods for specifying an
      IP address:  * IPv4 dotted decimal, as in `100.1.2.3` * Full URL, as in
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v
      1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL
      or by name, as in: * projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses
      /address-name * regions/region/addresses/address-name * global/addresses
      /address-name * address-name   The loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding
      rule's target determine the type of IP address that you can use. For
      detailed information, refer to [IP address specifications ](/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding-rule- concepts#ip_address_specifications).
    type: string
  IPProtocol:
    description: |-
      The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid
      options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP.  For Internal TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing, the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, and one of TCP or UDP
      are valid. For Traffic Director, the load balancing scheme is
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, and only TCPis valid. For Internal HTTP(S) Load
      Balancing, the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED, and only TCP is
      valid. For HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, and TCP Proxy Load Balancing, the load
      balancing scheme is EXTERNAL and only TCP is valid. For Network TCP/UDP
      Load Balancing, the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, and one of TCP or
      UDP is valid.

  allPorts:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. This field
      cannot be used with port or portRange fields. When the load balancing
      scheme is INTERNAL and protocol is TCP/UDP, specify this field to allow
      packets addressed to any ports will be forwarded to the backends
      configured with this forwarding rule.
    type: boolean
  allowGlobalAccess:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. If the
      field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise
      only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load
      balancer.
    type: boolean
  backendService:
    description: |-
      This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For internal load
      balancing, this field identifies the BackendService resource to receive
      the matched traffic.

    type: string
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  ipVersion:
    description: |-
      The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid options
      are IPV4 or IPV6. This can only be specified for an external global
      forwarding rule.
    type: string
    enum:
    - IPV4
    - IPV6
    - UNSPECIFIED_VERSION
  isMirroringCollector:
    description: |-
      Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
      packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load
      balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a PacketMirroring
      rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that
      have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
    type: boolean
  kind:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule for
      Forwarding Rule resources.
    type: string
  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      Specifies the forwarding rule type.    - EXTERNAL is used for:   - Classic
      Cloud VPN gateways  - Protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP
      address  - The following load balancers: HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy,
      and Network TCP/UDP     - INTERNAL is used for: - Protocol forwarding to
      VMs from an internal IP address  - Internal TCP/UDP load balancers    -
      INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for:   - Internal HTTP(S) load balancers    -
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED is used for:   - Traffic Director      For more
      information about forwarding rules, refer to Forwarding rule concepts.

    - INVALID
  metadataFilters:
    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
      configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
      requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a match
      takes place, the relevant configuration is made available to those
      proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap)
      referenced by the ForwardingRule will not be visible to those proxies. For
      each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to
      MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding
      label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to
      MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding
      labels provided in the metadata. metadataFilters specified here will be
      applifed before those specified in the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule
      references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: MetadataFilter.yaml
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    type: string
  network:
    description: |-
      This field is not used for external load balancing.  For INTERNAL and
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field identifies the
      network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding
      Rule. If this field is not specified, the default network will be
      used.
    type: string
  networkTier:
    description: |-
      This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load
      balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
      STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM.  If
      this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress
      is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the
      Address.
    type: string
    enum:
    - PREMIUM
    - STANDARD
  portRange:
    description: |-
      When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and
      INTERNAL_MANAGED, you can specify a port_range. Use with a forwarding
      rule that points to a target proxy or a target pool. Do not use with a
      forwarding rule that points to a backend service. This field is used
      along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy,
      TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool,
      TargetInstance.  Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
      only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be
      forwarded to target. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress,
      IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.  Some types of
      forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports:   -
    type: string
  ports:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal
      load balancing.  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a list of
      ports can be configured, for example, ['80'], ['8000','9000']. Only
      packets addressed to these ports are forwarded to the backends
      configured with the forwarding rule.  If the forwarding rule's
      loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL, you can specify ports in one of the
      following ways:  * A list of up to five ports, which can be non-
      contiguous * Keyword ALL, which causes the forwarding rule to forward
      traffic on any port of the forwarding rule's protocol.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  region:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule
      resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
      You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is
      not settable as a field in the request body.
    type: string
  selfLink:
    description: '[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.'
    type: string
  serviceLabel:
    description: |-
      An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
      If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified
      service name.  The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long
      and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and
      all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or
      digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.  This
      field is only used for internal load balancing.
    type: string
  serviceName:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for this
      Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    type: string
  subnetwork:
    description: |-
      This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For internal
      load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the load
      balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.  If the
      network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
      However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork
      must be specified.
    type: string
  target:
    description: |-
      The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must live in the same
      region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this
      target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded
      traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. For
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, only targetHttpProxy is
      valid, not targetHttpsProxy.
    type: string
