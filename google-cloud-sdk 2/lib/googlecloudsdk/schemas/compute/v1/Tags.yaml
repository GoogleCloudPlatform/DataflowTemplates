      Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of
      the tags' contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is
      initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to
      modify or update tags. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint
      hash in order to update or change tags.  To see the latest fingerprint,
      make get() request to the instance.
