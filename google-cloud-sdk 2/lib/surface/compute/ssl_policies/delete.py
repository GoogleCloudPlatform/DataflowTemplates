  *{command}* is used to delete one or more Compute Engine SSL policies.
  SSL policies can only be deleted when no other resources (e.g.,
  Target HTTPS proxies, Target SSL proxies) refer to them.

  An SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. An SSL
  policy can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This affects
  connections between clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load balancer. SSL
  policies do not affect the connection between the load balancers and the
  backends.
