<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
  The rb command deletes a bucket. Buckets must be empty before you can delete
  them.

  Be certain you want to delete a bucket before you do so, as once it is
  deleted the name becomes available and another user may create a bucket with
  that name. (But see also "DOMAIN NAMED BUCKETS" under "gsutil help naming"
  for help carving out parts of the bucket name space.)


<B>OPTIONS</B>
  -f          Continues silently (without printing error messages) despite
              errors when removing buckets. If some buckets couldn't be removed,
              gsutil's exit status will be non-zero even if this flag is set.
