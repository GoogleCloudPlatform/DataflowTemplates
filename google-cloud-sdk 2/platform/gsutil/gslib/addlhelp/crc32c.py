<B>OVERVIEW</B>
  Google Cloud Storage provides a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) header that
  allows clients to verify the integrity of object contents. For non-composite
  objects Google Cloud Storage also provides an MD5 header to allow clients to
  verify object integrity, but for composite objects only the CRC is available.
  gsutil automatically performs integrity checks on all uploads and downloads.
  Additionally, you can use the ``gsutil hash`` command to calculate a CRC for
  any local file.

  The CRC variant used by Google Cloud Storage is called CRC32C (Castagnoli),
  which is not available in the standard Python distribution. The implementation
  of CRC32C used by gsutil is provided by a third-party Python module called
  `crcmod <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod>`_.

  The crcmod module contains a pure-Python implementation of CRC32C, but using
  it results in very poor performance. A Python C extension is also provided by
  crcmod, which requires compiling into a binary module for use. gsutil ships
  with a precompiled crcmod C extension for macOS; for other platforms, see
  the installation instructions below.

  At the end of each copy operation, the ``gsutil cp`` and ``gsutil rsync``
  commands validate that the checksum of the source file/object matches the
  checksum of the destination file/object. If the checksums do not match,
  gsutil will delete the invalid copy and print a warning message. This very
  rarely happens, but if it does, please contact gs-team@google.com.


<B>CONFIGURATION</B>
  To determine if the compiled version of crcmod is available in your Python
  environment, you can inspect the output of the ``gsutil version`` command for
  the "compiled crcmod" entry:

    $ gsutil version -l
    ...
    compiled crcmod: True
    ...

  If your crcmod library is compiled to a native binary, this value will be
  True. If using the pure-Python version, the value will be False.

  To control gsutil's behavior in response to crcmod's status, you can set the
  "check_hashes" configuration variable. For details on this variable, see the
  surrounding comments in your boto configuration file. If "check_hashes"
  is not present in your configuration file, rerun ``gsutil config`` to
  regenerate the file.


<B>INSTALLATION</B>
  These installation instructions assume that:

  -  You have ``pip`` installed. Consult the `pip installation instructions
     <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ for details on how
     to install ``pip``.
  -  Your installation of ``pip`` can be found in your ``PATH`` environment
     variable. If it cannot, you may need to replace ``pip3`` in the commands
     below with the full path to the executable.
  -  You are installing the crcmod package for use with your system installation
     of Python, and thus use the ``sudo`` command. If installing crcmod for a
     different Python environment (e.g. in a virtualenv), you should omit
     ``sudo`` from the commands below.
  -  You are using a Python 3 version with gsutil. You can determine which
     Python version gsutil is using by running ``gsutil version -l`` and looking
     for the ``python version: 2.x.x`` or ``python version: 3.x.x`` line.

  CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora
  ------------------------

  To compile and install crcmod:

    yum install gcc python3-devel python3-setuptools redhat-rpm-config
    sudo pip3 uninstall crcmod
    sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod

  Debian and Ubuntu
  -----------------

  To compile and install crcmod:

    sudo apt-get install gcc python3-dev python3-setuptools
    sudo pip3 uninstall crcmod
    sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod

  Enterprise SUSE
  -----------------

  To compile and install crcmod:

    sudo zypper install gcc python3-devel
    sudo pip3 uninstall crcmod
    sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod

  macOS
  -----

  gsutil distributes a pre-compiled version of crcmod for macOS, so you shouldn't
  need to compile and install it yourself. If for some reason the pre-compiled
  version is not being detected, please let the Google Cloud Storage team know
  (see ``gsutil help support``).

  To compile manually on macOS, you will first need to install
  `XCode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ and then run:

    pip3 install -U crcmod

  Windows
  -------

  An installer is available for the compiled version of crcmod from the Python
  Package Index (PyPi) at the following URL:

  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod/1.7

  MSI installers are available for the 32-bit versions of Python 2.7.
  Make sure to install to a 32-bit Python directory. If you're using 64-bit
  Python it won't work with 32-bit crcmod, and instead you'll need to install
  32-bit Python in order to use crcmod.

  NOTE: If you have installed crcmod and gsutil hasn't detected it, it may have
  been installed to the wrong directory. It should be located at
  <python_dir>\\files\\Lib\\site-packages\\crcmod\\

  In some cases the installer will incorrectly install to
  <python_dir>\\Lib\\site-packages\\crcmod\\

  Manually copying the crcmod directory to the correct location should resolve
  the issue.
