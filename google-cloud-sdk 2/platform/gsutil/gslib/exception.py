  Because the syntax for conditions is fairly complex, it doesn't make sense to
  specify them on the command line using a colon-delimited set of values in the
  same way you'd specify simple bindings - it would be a complex and potentially
  surprising interface, which isn't what you want when dealing with permissions.

  Additionally, providing partial functionality -- e.g. if a policy contains
  bindings with conditions, still allow users to interact with bindings that
  don't contain conditions -- might sound tempting, but results in a bad user
  experience. Bindings can be thought of as a mapping from (role, condition) ->
  [members]. Thus, a user might think they're editing the binding for (role1,
  condition1), but they'd really be editing the binding for (role1, None). Thus,
  we just raise an error if we encounter a binding with conditions present, and
  encourage users to use "iam {get,set}" instead.
