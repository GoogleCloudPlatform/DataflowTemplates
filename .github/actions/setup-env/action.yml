# Action used to set up the environment. This assumes that we are using
# a Linux-based VM.
#
# General steps are:
#   1. Set up Java, which templates and tests are written in
#   2. Set up Go, which our CI/CD programs are written in
#   3. Build everything under cicd/cmd
#   4. Gets all the changed files
