/**
 * The {@code TextToPubsubStream} is a streaming version of {@code TextToPubsub} pipeline that
 * publishes records to Cloud Pub/Sub from a set of files. The pipeline continuously polls for new
 * files, reads them row-by-row and publishes each record as a string message. The polling interval
 * is fixed and equals to 10 seconds. At the moment, publishing messages with attributes is
 * unsupported.
