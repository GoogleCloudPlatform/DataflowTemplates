- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.41 (release date: 2019-07-16)
=======================================
New Features
------------------
- Added HMAC key management for service accounts. This includes a new "hmac"
  command to create/get/list/update/delete HMAC keys on service accounts.
  Currently, your project must be whitelisted for use with this new HMAC
  functionality. This restriction will be lifted in the near future.

 Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed bug where copying files > 100MiB from GCS to S3 was hanging.
- Fixed issue where content type was sometimes set improperly.


Release 4.40 (release date: 2019-07-01)

  some point afterward (TBD).

 Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed bug introduced in v4.39 where rsync would not correctly sync object/file
  names containing some special URL-encodable characters (e.g. "+" and
  whitespace characters).
- Fixed the update command so that it no longer fails when it detects the
  presence of additional top-level files that were added in the v4.39 release.

 Other Changes
------------------
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.39 (release date: 2019-06-13)
=======================================

- Fixed bug where IAM operations failed on buckets whose names lacked any
  letters.

 Other Changes
------------------
- Revised contribution guidelines to direct developers to submit GitHub pull
  requests instead of using the Rietveld code review tool.
- Several code changes to work toward Python 3 support (coming in a subsequent
  release).
- Several documentation and command help improvements.
- Various improvements to test stability and feedback.


Release 4.38 (release date: 2019-03-25)
=======================================
Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed issue where multiprocessing check would raise an exception if
  /etc/os-release was not in the expected format.

Other Changes
------------------
- Improved error message for trying to retrieve default object ACLs on a bucket
  with Bucket Policy Only enabled.

=======================================
Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed a bug where XML API requests would sometimes fail with SSLError
  exceptions due to SNI not being used for https connections.
- Fixed "du" output spacing for 6-digit sizes.

Other Changes
------------------
- Updated crcmod installation instructions for CentOS 6.


Release 4.36 (release date: 2019-01-28)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added Bucket Policy Only support to gsutil. This includes a new
  "bucketpolicyonly" command to get/set BPO on existing buckets, as well adding
  the ability to set BPO at bucket creation time with "mb -b". Currently, your
  project must be whitelisted for use with the new BPO functionality. This
  restriction will be lifted in the near future.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed a bug where "cp -n" would overwrite a local file at the destination if
  its size differed from the source's size.

Other Changes
------------------
- Updated crcmod installation instructions for enterprise SUSE systems.


Release 4.35 (release date: 2018-12-18)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added -u option to rsync; this will skip copying files/objects that are newer
  (as determined by checking mtime) at the destination.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- The "iam ch" command now allows supplying custom IAM roles.
- Fixed an issue where debug output was not displaying all of the loaded config
  files under the "config path(s)" label.
- Disabled running with multiple processes when running on Alpine Linux, as this
  would sometimes cause gsutil to hang forever. Running with multiple threads is
  still allowed.
- The "rsync" command now prints log messages during synchronization to indicate
  when symlinks are being skipped.
- The "Boto:ca_certificates_file" config option can now be overridden using
  the -o option.

Other Changes
------------------
- Disallowed installing gsutil on Python versions != 2.7.
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.34 (release date: 2018-09-11)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added bucket lock support to gsutil. Currently, your project must be
  whitelisted for use with the new bucket lock functionality. This restriction
  will be lifted in the near future.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed issue where "rsync -P" would fail if run as the root user.
- Fixed an issue with credential caching where the source credentials for an
  entity would change but the old cached credentials would still be used.

Other Changes
------------------
- OAuth2 token exchanges now go to https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token instead
  of https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token. Users using gsutil behind a
  firewall may need to adjust their firewall rules.
- If invoked via the Cloud SDK, gsutil's debug output now displays the path to
  gcloud's gsutil wrapper script for "gsutil path", rather than the actual entry
  point for the bundled gsutil component.
- Improved error messages for failed Cloud KMS requests.
- Improved error messages for "iam ch" command to clarify that assigning
  roles to project convenience groups (e.g. "projectEditor") is not allowed.
- Enhanced perfdiag command to include GCE instance details (if applicable)
  and the target bucket's location and storage class.
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.33 (release date: 2018-06-21)
=======================================
Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed an issue with the "rsync" command on Windows that would cause gsutil
  to incorrectly join file path segments when the source given was the root
  of a drive, e.g. "C:".
- Fixed several places where gsutil referenced a variable that had not been
  correctly imported.

Other Changes
------------------
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.32 (release date: 2018-06-01)
=======================================
Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed a file path resolution issue on Windows that affected local-to-cloud
  copy-based operations ("cp", "mv", "rsync"). If a local file URI containing
  relative path components ("." or "..") or forward slashes (rather than
  backslashes) was provided as a source argument, the resulting destination
  object(s) was incorrectly named. For recursive operations, this resulted in
  several files being copied to the same object path, overwriting each other.
- Fixed an issue with the "rsync" command on Windows that resulted in each rsync
  invocation not being able to delete its temporary synchronization files on
  disk.
- Fixed an issue where reading a specific generation of an object from S3 would
  fail.
- Fixed an issue where running gsutil with the top-level "-q" flag would result
  in credential-related logging statements being emitted to stderr.
- Gsutil no longer allows copying from streamed input if the top-level "-m" flag
  is specified. While this was previously allowed, it did not work correctly.

Other Changes
------------------
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.31 (release date: 2018-04-26)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added support for reauthentication within gsutil. Note that this only affects
  authentication when "gs_oauth2_refresh_token" is configured under the
  "Credentials" section of the boto config file and that token corresponds to a
  user account enrolled in 2-step verification.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- When creating a signed URL via the "signurl" command, gsutil now verifies that
  the specified expiration isn't longer than 7 days (the maximum allowed by the
  service).
- To support rewriting objects to be encrypted using a bucket's default KMS key,
  the "rewrite" command now rewrites all specified objects if no value is
  specified for "encryption_key" under the "GSUtil" section in the boto config
  file.

Other Changes
------------------
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.30 (release date: 2018-03-28)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added Cloud KMS support for Google Cloud Storage resources, allowing the use
  of customer-managed encryption keys (CMEKs). Bucket-related functionality
  includes the new "kms" command, which can be used to get or set a bucket's
  default KMS key. Concerning objects, users may now specify the CMEK to be used
  for encryption via their boto config file, in the "encryption_key" attribute.
  In this way, users may specify either a CSEK or a CMEK to encrypt new objects,
  but not both. For more information, see "gsutil help encryption".

Other Changes
------------------
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.29 (release date: 2018-03-14)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added transport compression support, available through the "-j" and "-J"
  options for the "cp", "mv", and "rsync" commands. This is useful when
  uploading files with highly-compressible content. When specificed, files being
  uploaded are compressed on-the-fly in memory, sent to GCS, and uncompressed by
  GCS before they are stored. See "gsutil help cp" for additional information.
- When "use_magicfile=True" is set in the boto config file, gsutil will now
  append the detected charset, if present, to the object's Content-Type metadata
  field. For example, a Content-Type might be populated with
  "text/html; charset=us-ascii" rather than simply "text/html".

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Improved error handling and logging for upload resumption.
- After encountering a PreconditionException, the "acl ch" command will now
  re-fetch the object generation before retrying.
- Fixed issue with parsing lifecycle conditions when using the XML API.
  Conditions whose values could be evaluated by Python as "falsy" (e.g. setting
  an "age" condition to the number 0 or "isLive" to false) would be omitted from
  the lifecycle configuration when "prefer_api=xml" was set in the boto config
  file. Note that the JSON API is preferred by default, so most users were
  unlikely to encounter this issue.
- For commands that fetch bucket ACLs or default ACLs, when the user does not
  have storage.buckets.getIamPolicy on the GCS bucket, using the XML API will
  now behave consistently with the JSON API and display ACL/default ACL fields
  as empty, rather than throwing a CommandException.

Other Changes
------------------
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.
- The "signurl" command now uses signature V4 signing format to generate URLs.


Release 4.28 (release date: 2017-10-11)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added newest version of the Boto library, which includes support for using
  Signature Version 4 to connect to S3 buckets via the "use-sigv4 = True" and
  "host = s3.<region>.amazonaws.com" Boto options under the "[s3]" section.
- Added support for Requester Pays functionality when making requests to GCS
  buckets with this feature enabled. For example usage, see the entry for "-u"
  in "gsutil help options". Requester Pays is currently only supported for
  requests using the GCS JSON API; XML API support will be added in a later
  version.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed issue where attempting to preserve ACLs by using "-p" with cp/mv/rsync
  would fail when the destination is a local file.
- Improved quality of several ambiguous error messages.

Other Changes
------------------
- The proxy_rdns option is now True by default when a proxy is set. Also added
  Boto config file comments explaining that gcloud proxy options, if present,
  take precedence over corresponding Boto settings and environment variable
  settings.
- Following the deprecation of Python 2.6 support for gsutil, code sections that
  were only present to support Python 2.6 have been removed.
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.27 (release date: 2017-06-29)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- When using the JSON API, the "ls -L" and "stat" commands now print an object's
  storage class update time if it differs from the object's creation time; this
  occurs when the storage class has been changed due to the bucket's lifecycle
  management configuration.
- Listing a bucket's metadata via "ls -Lb" now prints its metageneration.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- When specifying custom metadata values using the top-level -h option, such
  values may now include unicode characters as well as multiple ":" characters.
- For Cloud SDK (gcloud) distributions of gsutil, if you have configured the
  Cloud SDK to not pass credentials to gsutil (by running "gcloud config set
  pass_credentials_to_gsutil false"), gsutil will now correctly work with
  credentials obtained via "gsutil config". This would previously result in an
  error with a message to run "gcloud auth login". Additionally, the "gsutil
  config" command no longer prompts users to run "gcloud auth login" if this
  option is set to false. This should allow switching between stand-alone
  gsutil installations and gcloud-packaged gsutil installations more easily.
- The config_file_list section in debug output now displays files in the order
  that they are loaded.

Other Changes
------------------
- Added XML support for some commands which previously only worked via the JSON
  API ("lifecycle" and "defstorageclass").
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.26 (release date: 2017-05-03)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- The cp command now supports reading from and writing to named pipes.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed issue where tab completion wasn't working.
- Fixed issue when using the XML API where gsutil would fail to parse bucket
  metadata for buckets using Lifecycle rules containing the SetStorageClass
  action or MatchesStorageClass condition.

Other Changes
------------------
- Removed -o flag from "notification create" command. The same functionality is
  available with the -p flag; the -o flag had been mistakenly added in a
  previous change.
- Removed the alpha disclaimer from the iam command help text.
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.


Release 4.25 (release date: 2017-04-05)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added bucket label support to gsutil. For more details, see
  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/label-or-tag-resources.
- Added the label command, which can be used to get, set, and change the labels
  for an existing bucket (known as "tags" for S3 buckets).
- Listing a bucket via "gsutil ls -Lb" now also displays the labels, if any
  exist, that are currently set on it.


Release 4.24 (release date: 2017-03-27)
=======================================
New Features
------------------
- Added support for configuring GCS Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. For more
  details, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications.
- Added support for specifying canned ACLs when using the rsync command.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed a bug where error messages about invalid object names did not correctly
  display the problematic object name.


Release 4.23 (release date: 2017-03-09)
=======================================
Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed "referenced before assignment" error in some copy_helper exceptions for
  resumable uploads and non-resumable cloud-to-local downloads.
- The setmeta command now properly supports case sensitivity in custom metadata
  keys when using the JSON API.
- Fixed a resource leak affecting Windows in cases where single-process,
  multithreaded parallelism is used that would result in an OSError with the
  message "Too many open files".
- Fixed HTTPError initialization failure in signurl command.
- Fixed signurl issue where attempting to validate short-lived URLs on a slow
  connection would fail because of URL expiration.
- Fixed a bug where cp -r would not properly resolve wildcards for
  cloud-to-cloud copies.
- Fixed a bug where cp -e -r would copy symlinks.
- Fixed a bug where cp -P would fail on Windows.
- Fixed a bug where version -l might not show all boto configuration files.
- Running perfdiag now only lists the objects that were created by that run of
  perfdiag. This fixes an issue where running perfdiag against an existing
  bucket with many objects in it could take a long time.


Other Changes
------------------
- Simplified parallelism when using a single process with multiple threads.
  With this change, gsutil will spawn a new thread pool per level of
  parallelism. As an example, if you specify that you want a
  parellel_thread_count of 24, this will result in 24 worker threads, except
  when you're using parallel composite uploads or sliced downloads, in which
  case 48 (24 * 2) worker threads will be used.
- Extended the early deletion warning threshold when moving Coldline objects
  to 90 days after object creation.
- Improved several error messages and warnings.
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.

Release 4.22 (release date: 2016-10-20)
=======================================
New features
------------------
- Added per-object storage class functionality to gsutil. For more details, see
  https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/per-object-storage-class.
- Added the defstorageclass command, which can be used to get and set an
  existing bucket's default storage class.
- The cp, mv, and rewrite commands now support the "-s" option, allowing users
  to specify the storage class for destination object(s). When no storage class
  is specified, the object's storage class will be assigned from either its
  bucket's default storage class (cp/mv commands) or the source object's
  storage class (rewrite command).

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed a bug in POSIX preservation for the cp and mv commands where POSIX
  attributes were not propagated to cloud objects, even when the -P flag was
  present.
- Fixed a bug in setmeta where removing custom metadata would add an
  empty-string value if the key did not already exist.
- Content-Type is now obtained from symlink targets, rather than symlinks
  themselves, when the use_magicfile option is set in the .boto configuration
  file.

Other Changes
------------------
- Analytics reporting now includes performance metrics such as average
  throughput and thread idle time.
- The iam set command now supports a -e option to specify an etag precondition
  check. The IAM policy file returned by iam get and used by iam set has also
  been altered to include this field.
- Default limit for max number of processes changed to 64.
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.

Release 4.21 (release date: 2016-08-16)
=======================================
New Features
------------------
- The console output for many commands has been improved to display
  command progress.
- The cp, mv, and rsync commands now support a -P option that preserves
  POSIX file attributes from the source. Currently, mode, gid, uid,
  atime, and mtime attributes are supported for uploads, downloads,
  and copies.
- gsutil can now optionally report anonymous usage statistics that help
  gsutil developers improve the tool. For non-gcloud distributions,
  prompts have been added to the config and update commands. Prompts can
  be disabled via the disable_analytics_prompt value in the .boto
  configuration file.
- Added the iam commmand, which can be used to set IAM policies on
  Google Cloud Storage buckets and objects. This feature is currently in
  alpha and requires a whitelist application to use it - see
  "gsutil help iam" for  details.
- The hash command now supports retrieving hashes for cloud objects.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed a bug where rsync -e -r could fail for subdirectories with
  broken symlinks.
- Fixed an access error when interacting with S3 user-specific
  directories.

Other Changes
------------------
- Updated boto library dependency to 2.42.0.

Release 4.20 (release date: 2016-07-20)
=======================================
New Features
------------------
- gsutil now outputs a message that estimates the total number of objects for
  commands affecting more than 30,000 objects. This value can be adjusted via
  task_estimation_threshold in the .boto configuration file.

Bug Fixes
------------------
- Fixed a bug in resumable downloads that could raise UnboundLocalError if
  the download file was not readable.
- Updated oauth2client to version 2.2.0, fixing some IOError and OSError cases.
- Fixed bug in gsutil ls that would show update time instead of creation
  time when using the JSON API and -L or -l flags.
- Fixed a bug in gsutil rsync -d that could cause erroneous removal of
  an extra destination object.
- Fixed downloads to include accept-encoding:gzip logic when appropriate.

Other Changes
------------------
- gsutil rsync now stores modification time (mtime) for cloud objects.
- Changed the default change detection algorithm of gsutil rsync from file
  size to file mtime, falling back to checksum and finally file
  size as alternatives. This allows for increased accuracy of rsync without
  the speed sacrifice that comes from checksum calculation, and makes gsutil
  rsync work more similarly to how Linux rsync works. Note that the first
  run of a local-to-cloud rsync using this new algorithm may be slower than
  subsequent runs, as the cloud objects will not initially have an mtime, and
  the algorithm will fall back to the slower checksum-based alternative in
  addition to adding mtime to the cloud objects.
- When using the JSON API, gsutil will output a progress message before
  retrying a request if enough time has passed since the first attempt.
- Improved error detection in dry runs of gsutil rsync by attempting to open
  files that would be copied.
- Added time created and time updated properties to output of gsutil ls -Lb.
- Added archived time property to output of gsutil ls -La and gsutil stat.
- Changed minimum number of source objects for gsutil compose from 2 to 1.
- Removed an HTTP metadata get call from cp, acl, and setmeta commands. This
  improves the speed of gsutil cp for small objects by over 50%.
- Several documentation updates and clarifications.

Release 4.19 (release date: 2016-04-13)
=======================================
Deprecation Notice
------------------
- gsutil support for Python 2.6 is deprecated, and gsutil will stop
  supporting Python 2.6 on September 1, 2016. This change is
  being made for two reasons. First, Python 2.6 stopped
  receiving security patches since October 2013. Second,
  removing Python 2.6 support will enable gsutil to add support
  for Python 3. Versions of gsutil released prior to September 1,
  2016 will continue to work with Python 2.6. However, bug fixes
  will not be made retroactively to older gsutil versions, and users
  reporting bugs will be asked to upgrade to the current gsutil
  version (using Python 2.7, or, when it is supported, Python 3).

Other Changes
-------------
- Improved documentation around Cloud SDK (gcloud) installs.

Release 4.18 (release date: 2016-03-22)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- gsutil now supports the beta Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys
  features for Google Cloud Storage objects, via the JSON API.
  This feature allows you to encrypt your data with keys that
  are not permanently stored on Google's servers. You can provide
  encryption and decryption keys in your .boto configuration file.
  As long as an encryption key is specified in the configuration file,
  all gs:// objects that gsutil creates will be stored encrypted
  with that key, and all encrypted objects will be decrypted when
  downloaded. See "gsutil help csek" for more information.
- Added the rewrite command, which can be used to perform
  key rotation for objects encrypted with customer-supplied
  encryption keys.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed an AttributeError that could occur when running in debug mode
  for operations involving wildcards, recursion, or listing.
- Fixed an ArgumentException that could occur when using perfdiag
  write throughput tests with parallelism.
- Restored debug mode output for resumable uploads using the JSON API.
- Fixed a bug where rm -r on a bucket subdirectory would exit with
  code 1 even though it succeeded.
- Fixed a bug where cp -R of a single file with a destination other
  than the bucket root would copy to the bucket root.
- Fixed a bug when using a single process with multiple threads
  where CTRL-C would not stop the process until one thread completed
  a task.

Other Changes
-------------
- Improved exception logging in debug mode.
- Added "cache-control: no-transform" to all uploads
  using compression ("gsutil cp -z" or "gsutil cp -Z") to ensure that
  doubly-compressed objects can be downloaded with data integrity
  checking.
- Reduced the default number of threads per-process on Linux systems
  from 10 to 5.
- Documented additional OS X Unicode limitations.
- The config command now includes the custom client ID and secret in the
  configuration file output if the command is run with those values
  configured.

Release 4.17 (release date: 2016-02-18)
=======================================
Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed an oauth2client dependency break that caused
  the PyPi distribution of gsutil to allow oauth2client 2.0.0,
  causing all commands to fail with an ImportError.
- Fixed a bug where gsutil could leak multiprocessing.Manager
  processes when terminating signals (such as CTRL-C) were sent.
- Fixed a bug where the -q option did not suppress output
  from the stat command.
- Fixed a bug where deleting an empty bucket with rm -r
  would return a non-zero exit code even when successful.
- Fixed UnicodeEncodeErrors that could occur when using the du
  command with a pipe on objects containing non-ASCII characters.

Other Changes
-------------
- Many documentation improvements and clarifications.

Release 4.16 (release date: 2015-11-25)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- The ls command now supports a -d option (similar to Unix ls -d)
  for suppressing recursion into subdirectories.
- The signurl command now accepts JSON-format private key files
  generated by the Google Developers Console.
- The signurl command now supports generating resumable upload
  start URLs.
- The cp command now supports a -Z option which will gzip-compress all
  files (regardless of their extensions) as they are uploaded.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug where an expired OAuth2 token could include the OAuth2
  token response as part of the download, causing it to fail end-to-end
  integrity checks and be deleted.
- Fixed a bug where streaming downloads using the JSON API would restart
  from the beginning of the stream if the connection broke. This bug
  could also cause data corruption in streaming downloads, because
  streaming downloads are not validated with end-to-end integrity checks.
- Fixed an internal_failure exception that could occur when an OAuth2
  token refresh returned a transient error, such as an HTTP 503.
- Fixed a resource deadlock exception in oauth2client that could cause
  sliced downloads to hang.
- Fixed a bug where cp/rsync -p would use the default object
  ACL for the destination object if the caller did not have OWNER
  permission on the source object.
- Fixed a potential race condition when using perfdiag with multiple
  threads and/or processes.
- Fixed an AttributeError that could occur when using acl ch -p.
- Fixed a bug where the mv command did not properly handle the global
  -m flag.
- Fixed a UnicodeEncodeError that could occur when iterating over
  non-Unicode-named directories.
- Fixed a bug where an object name including a wildcard could cause
  an infinite loop during a recursive listing.
- Fixed a Unicode bug when using cp or ls on Windows on an object
  containing certain Unicode characters. However, even with this fix
  Unicode can still be problematic on Windows; consult
  "gsutil help encoding" for details.
- Fixed a Windows performance issue during rsync diff generation.
- Fixed a bug in the ordering of ls output.
- Fixed a bug where Windows help output included ANSI escape codes.
- Fixed a compatibility bug with perfdiag -i with input generated prior
  to gsutil 4.14.

Other Changes
-------------
- Several documentation updates, including rsync exclusion pattern matching,
  service account configuration, cp/rsync recursion flags, multi-object rm,
  versioned URL removal, destination subdirectory naming, wildcard behavior,
  regional buckets, and s3 connection reset.
- Improvements to Unicode documentation including LANG variable and iconv
  tool.

Release 4.15 (release date: 2015-09-08)
=======================================
Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed an OverflowError in apitools that caused download
  failures for large files on 32-bit machines.
- Removed unnecessary sending of range headers for downloads when
  using the XML API.
- Fixed a bug that caused perfdiag to report extremely high throughput
  when the -p flag was unspecified and exactly one of the -c or -k flags
  were specified.
- Fixed a ValueError that occurred on Python 2.6 with sliced object downloads.

Other Changes
-------------
- HTTP connections for downloads and uploads in the JSON API are now
  re-used per-thread.
- When gsutil's automatic update feature prompts and the user
  chooses to update, gsutil will now exit with status code 1 after
  updating (because the original command was not executed).
- The cp -A flag is disabled when using gsutil -m to ensure that
  ordering is preserved when copying between versioned buckets.

Release 4.14 (release date: 2015-08-24)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- Implemented Sliced Object Download feature.
  This breaks up a single large object into multiple pieces and
  downloads them in parallel, improving performance. The gsutil cp, mv
  and rsync commands now use this by default when compiled crcmod
  is available for performing fast end-to-end integrity checks.
  If compiled crcmod is not available, normal object download will
  be used. Sliced download can be used in conjunction with the global -m
  flag for maximum performance to download multiple objects in
  parallel while additionally slicing each object.
  See the "SLICED OBJECT DOWNLOAD" section of "gsutil help cp" for
  details.
  Note: sliced download may cause performance degradation for disks
  with very slow seek times. You can disable this feature by setting
  sliced_object_download_threshold = 0 in your .boto configuration file.
- Added rthru_file and wthru_file test modes to perfdiag, allowing
  measurement of reads and writes from a disk. This also allows
  measurement of transferring objects too large to fit in memory.
  The size restriction of 20GiB has been lifted.
- perfdiag now supports a -p flag to choose a parallelism strategy
  (slice, fan, or both) when using multiple threads and/or processes.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed an IOError that could occur in apitools when acquiring credentials
  using multiple threads and/or processes on Google Compute Engine.
- Fixed a bug where rm -r would attempt to delete a nonexistent bucket.
- Fixed a bug where a default object ACL could not be set or changed to empty.
- Fixed a bug where cached credentials corresponding to an old account could
  be used (for example, credentials associated with a prior .boto
  configuration file).
- Fixed a bug in apitools for retrieving byte ranges of size 1 (for example,
  "cat -r 1-1 ...")
- Fixed a bug that caused the main gsutil process to perform all work leaving
  all gsutil child processes idle.
- Fixed a bug that caused multiple threads not to be used when
  multiprocessing was unavailable.
- Fixed a bug that caused rsync to skip files that start with "." when the
  -r option was not used.
- Fixed a bug that caused rsync -C to bail out when it failed to read
  a source file.
- Fixed a bug where gsutil stat printed unwanted output to stderr.
- Fixed a bug where a parallel composite upload could return a nonzero exit
  code even though the upload completed successfully. This occurred if
  temporary component deletion triggered a retry but the original request
  succeeded.
- Fixed a bug where gsutil would exit with code 0 when both running in
  debug mode and encountering an unhandled exception.
- Fixed a bug where gsutil would suggest using parallel composite uploads
  multiple times.

Other Changes
-------------
- Bucket removal is now supported even if billing is disabled for that bucket.
- Refactored Windows installs to no longer use any multiprocessing module
  functions, as gsutil has never supported multiple processes on Windows.
  Multithreading is unaffected and still available on Windows.
- All downloads are now written to a temporary file with a "_.gstmp" suffix
  while the download is still in progress.
- Re-hashing of existing bytes when resuming downloads now displays progress.
- Reduced the total number of multiprocessing.Manager processes to two.
- The rm command now correctly counts the number of objects that could
  not be removed.
- Increased the default retries to match the Google Cloud Storage SLA.
  By default, gsutil will now retry 23 times with exponential backoff up
  to 32 seconds, for a total timespan of ~10 minutes.
- Improved bucket subdirectory checks to a single HTTP call. Detection of
  _$folder$ placeholder objects is now eventually consistent.
- Eliminated two unnecessary HTTP calls when performing uploads via
  the cp, mv, or rsync commands.
- Updated documentation for several topics including acl, cache-control,
  crcmod, cp, mb, rsync, and subdirs.
- Added a warning about using parallel composite upload with NEARLINE
  storage-class buckets.

Release 4.13 (release date: 2015-06-03)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- Added -U flag to cp and rsync commands to allow skipping of unsupported
  object types.
- Added support for Google Developer Shell credentials.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Precondition headers (x-goog-if-...) are now respected for the setmeta
  command.
- Fixed an index out of range error that could occur with an empty
  parallel composite upload tracker file.
- The stat command outputs errors to stderr instead of stdout.
- Fixed two possible sources of ResumableUploadStartOverException from
  httplib2 and oauth2client.
- Fixed a bug in the compose command where a missing source object resulted
  in an error message claiming the destination object was missing.

Other Changes
-------------
- Added a help section on throttling gsutil.
- Resumable uploads will now start over if a PUT to the upload ID returns
  an HTTP 404. Previously this behavior applied only to an HTTP 410.
- XML API resumable uploads now retry on HTTP 429 errors, matching the
  behavior of JSON API resumable uploads.
- Improved response to process kill signals, reducing the likelihood of
  leaving orphaned child processes and temporary files.

- Removed the deprecated setmeta -n option.


Release 4.12 (release date: 2015-04-20)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- Added support for JSON-format service account private key files.
- Added support for the Rewrite API (JSON API only). This is used for
  all copies within the Google Cloud and supports copying objects across
  storage classes and/or locations.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug that could cause downloads to have a hash mismatch (and deletion
  of the corrupted file) when resumed across process breaks via a tracker file.

Other Changes
-------------
- Updated documentation and examples for several topics including
  acl, cp, dev, signurl, stat, and wildcards.


Release 4.11 (release date: 2015-03-10)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- Added Nearline storage class support to the mb command.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug for streaming uploads that could occasionally cause a HTTP 410
  from the service or a hash mismatch (and deletion of the corrutped file).
- Fixed an OverflowError that occurred when uploading files > 4GiB on a 32-bit
  operating system.

Other Changes
-------------
- Added documentation around using the Content-MD5 header to extend integrity
  checking to include checksums computed by a client-side content pipeline.


Release 4.10 (release date: 2015-03-03)
=======================================
Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug that could cause undetected data corruption (preserving incorrect
  data) if a streaming upload encountered a service error on non-8KiB-aligned
  boundary.
- Fixed a bug that caused downloads to be truncated if the connection broke,
  resulting in a hash mismatch (and deletion of the corrupted file) for that
  download.
- Fixed a format string arguments error that occurred if a download exhausted
  all retries.

Other Changes
-------------
- The lifecycle command now accepts JSON input in the form of
  "{ "lifecycle": { "rule" ..." in addition to "{ "rule": ...".

Release 4.9 (release date: 2015-02-13)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- When using the JSON API, the ch acl/defacl subcommand now supports
  project groups via the -p flag. For details, see "gsutil help acl ch".

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug that caused daisy-chain copies (including cross-provider
  copies) for files large than 100MiB to fail.
- Fixed a bug that caused streaming uploads than ran for longer than
  an hour to fail with HTTP 400s.
- Fixed a bug where perfdiag would not properly clean up its test files.
- Fixed a bug where using ls with the XML API could mistakenly report bucket
  configuration as present.

Other Changes
-------------
- Updated documentation for metadata, retries, security, and subdirs.
- Tracker files are no longer written for small downloads.


Release 4.8 (release date: 2015-01-23)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- gsutil now supports HTTP proxy configuration via the http_proxy,
  https_proxy, or HTTPS_PROXY environment variables. This configuration
  is used only if proxy configuration is not present in the .boto
  configuration file.
- gsutil rsync now supports regex-based source and destination URL
  exclusion via the -x flag.
- The rm command now supports arguments on stdin via the -I flag.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug where perfdiag would fail if netstat was not available.
- Fixed a bug where temporary ca_certs files were not being cleaned up.
- Fixed a bug in rsync to unnecessarily remove or write objects, in some
  cases leaving the destination in a non-synchronized state.
  caused rsync to unnecessarily remove or rewrite objects.
- Fixed a bug where rsync temporary listing files were not being
  cleaned up when the rsync process was killed.
- Fixed a bug where rsync would remove destination URLs if listing the
  source encountered a non-retryable failure (for example, if the source
  did not exist).
- Fixed a bug where mv would fail for some Unicode filenames.
- Fixed a bug where mv would remove the source URL after skipping the
  destination URL.
- Fixed a bug that caused daisy chain uploads to hang if the download thread
  raised an exception.
- Fixed a bug where acl ch would return a zero exit code even if it failed.
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the progress display to render multiple
  times at the end of an upload or download.

Other Changes
-------------
- Resumable uploads of files using the JSON API now send their data in a
  single request, making separate HTTP calls only when resuming is necessary.
- The test command now runs tests in parallel by default, and test
  parallelism on Windows is now supported.
- All non-streaming downloads are now resumable (and retryable) by default,
  regardless of size.
- Canned ACLs and canned default object ACLs are now supported in the JSON
  API (previously they would fall back to using the XML API).
- Google Compute Engine service account credential tokens are now cached,
  avoiding unnecessary refreshes.
- Improved detection of the Google Compute Engine metadata server,
  particularly when using the -m flag for multiprocessing.
- Added new help sections about filename encoding and security/privacy
  considerations.
- Download progress is now displayed for small XML API downloads.


Release 4.7 (release date: 2014-11-17)
=======================================
New Features
------------
- Tab completion now works on gs:// URLs (for Cloud SDK installs only).
  To install via Cloud SDK, see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#Quick_Start
- Streaming uploads (with source URL "-") using the JSON API now buffer
  in-memory up to 100MB, allowing large streams to be retried in the event
  of network flakiness or service errors.
- Resumable uploads that receive a fatal service error (typically a 410)
  are now automatically retried from the beginning.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed an apitools bug that impacted upload performance and caused
  "Retrying from byte __ after exception" to print after every 100MiB.
- Fixed _$folder$ placeholder object detection on versioned buckets.
- Removed an unnecessary credential check on load which increased
  startup time by over one second in some cases.
- SignURL now properly retries when checking if the signed object is
  readable.
- Files with both Content-Encoding and Content-Type gzip are now properly
  removed when hash validation fails (only one of the two should be set).
- The x-goog-if-generation-match:0 header now works properly with the XML API.
- Fixed a bug that caused "defacl ch" on a bucket with a private ACL to fail.
- The rm command now properly supports precondition headers.
- Fixed a bug that caused large streaming uploads to fail with the message
  "Failure: length too large" when using the JSON API.
- Fixed a bug that caused JSON lifecycle configurations with createdBefore
  conditions to fail with a DecodeError.

Other Changes
-------------
- Byte counts now display accurate abbreviations of binary sizing. For example,
  messages previously labeled MB are now properly labeled MiB to indicate
  2**20 bytes. Only the labeling changed - the actual sizes were always binary.
- Improved Cloud SDK integration, including improved error messages
  and instructions.
- The num_retries .boto configuration value now applies to all requests
  (previously it was ignored for JSON API requests).
- rsync now works with non-existent destination subdirectories.
- Raised the default resumable upload threshold from 2MB to 8MB to
  improve performance.
- Benign retry messages now print only when debug mode is enabled via the
  top-level -d flag.
- The top-level -q flag now suppresses suggestions to use the -m flag.
- Command synopsis is now output when the wrong number of arguments are
  provided.
- Removed dependency on google-api-python-client module, added dependencies on

  when for running in debug mode (-D).

Other Changes
-------------
- Added the proxy_rdns configuration variable for clients that
  do DNS lookups via a proxy.
- Added the state_dir configuration variable for choosing the location of
  gsutil's internal state files, including resumable transfer tracker files.
  resumable_tracker_dir configuration variable is now deprecated.
- Added DNS, connection latency, and proxy use information to perfdiag
  command.
- perfdiag command will not perform DNS lookups if they are disabled in
  boto config.
- perfdiag command will now only attempt to delete uploaded objects when
  running write tests.
- Added code coverage support to test command.
- rsync -d now succeeds on a 404 for a to-be-deleted object (for example, when
  the object was already deleted by an external process).

Release 4.5 (release date: 2014-08-14)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug that caused resumable uploads to restart if gsutil was
  terminated with CTRL-C.
- Fixed a bug in defacl ch command that caused a failure when updating
  an existing default object ACL entry.
- Fixed an invalid literal bug during rsync file listing.
- Made several improvements to JSON upload stability, including fixing a bug
  which occasionally caused resumable upload hashes not to catch up properly.
- All JSON calls now have socket timeouts, eliminating hangs under
  flaky network conditions.
- Fixed a bug where acl ch -g AllAuthenticatedUsers would instead add
  AllUsers.
- Fixed a bug that caused object custom metadata not to be preserved when
  copying in the cloud.
- Fixed a bug where du -s did not properly elide subdirectories.

Other Changes
-------------
- Parallel composite uploads are now disabled by default until crcmod is
  available in major Linux distributions. To re-enable the setting from
  prior versions, in the [GSUtil] section of your .boto config file, add:
  parallel_composite_upload_threshold=150M
- Non-wildcarded URLs for existing objects now use Get before trying List
  (as in gsutil3), and thus are not subject to eventual listing consistency.
- gsutil -D now redacts proxy configuration values in the output.

Release 4.4 (release date: 2014-07-17)
=======================================

New Features
------------
- Added the hash command, which can calculate hashes of local files.
  gsutil already calculates hashes for integrity checking, but this allows
  the user to separately calculate the MD5 and CRC32c hashes of a local file.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Many improvements to JSON API media transfers, including far
  more robust retry logic.
- Fixed "File changed during upload: EOF..." errors on XML resumable uploads.
- Fixed rsync command to read and write index files in binary mode.
- Fix potential TypeError in _CheckAndHandleCredentialException.
- Fixed possible data corruption when using JSON API uploads for
  small files with lines starting with "From:", which would cause
  integrity checks to fail.
- Fixed gsutil cp to skip directory placeholders when downloading, avoiding
  "directory exists where the file needs to be created" errors.
- Fixed daisy chain cp/rsync for files >= 100MB.
- Fixed a bug in JSON proxy support where the proxy info was sometimes unused.
- Fixed a bug where an acl get on a private default object ACL returned an
  error instead of a blank ACL.
- Fixed a JSON API issue with large HTTP responses on 32-bit systems.

Other Changes
-------------
- Improved object listing performance when using the XML API.
- Improved various error messages.
- Improved progress display during media transfer.
- Switched to truncated exponential backoff for retries.
- Improved OS-specific ulimit checks.
- Added some information such as OS and Cloud SDK wrapping to gsutil version,
  and changed the output format to be more uniform.
- Daisy chain cp/rsync now supports resumable uploads.
- Improved proxy support for proxy username and passwords.
- x-amz headers are now supported for cp, rsync, and setmeta.  x-amz-meta
  headers continue to be supported as well.

Release 4.3 (release date: 2014-06-10)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix acl/defacl ch changing the role of an existing group.
- Fix unicode and 404 errors when using manifests.
- Fix parallelism configuration bug that limited gsutil rsync to two threads
  and could lead to rsync hangs. "gsutil -m rsync" runs much faster, and rsync
  uploads of large local files are now faster via parallel composite upload.
  Parallel composite uploads of large files are also faster.
- Fix rsync bug with parallel composite uploads.
- Fix TypeError that could occur when running the cp command with no
  credentials.

Other Changes
-------------
- Progress indicators for -m cp/rsync commands are now more readable.
- Added command being run to gsutil -d/-D output.
- Lowered default parallelism for 'gsutil -m test' and added hang detection.

Release 4.2 (release date: 2014-06-05)
=======================================

New Features
------------
- Added parallel test execution support to test command, ex: "gsutil -m test"

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix failure during retry of an XML download.
- Moved to boto release 2.29.1 fixing boto authentication erroneously
  reporting OAuth2 credentials as invalid.
- Fix parallel composite uploads when using only a single process and thread.
- Fix an invalid seek during daisy chain operation that affected file copy
  from Google Cloud Storage -> S3 for files greater than 8KB in size.
- Fix "gsutil acl ch" with AllUsers or AllAuthenticatedUsers groups.
- Fix some copy errors writing new lines to the manifest file.
- Fix "gsutil test" return code to properly be 0 on success.

Other Changes
-------------
- "gsutil cp -z" now ignores whitespace in the extension list.

Release 4.1 (release date: 2014-05-28)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug in parallel composite uploads where uploads with
  existing components would fail.
- Moved gcs-oauth2-boto-plugin to version 1.5, fixing a bug in the PyPi gsutil
  distribution that would cause gsutil to unnecessarily attempt to query
  the Google Compute Engine metadata service.

Other Changes
-------------
- Parallel composite uploads no longer specify an if-not-match precondition
  when uploading component parts.
- Parallel composite uploads no longer calculate a CRC32c hash prior to
  uploading component parts (these are still validated by an MD5 hash).
- Removed apitools dependency on gflags.

Release 4.0 (release date: 2014-05-27)
=======================================

Major New Gsutil Version - Backwards-Incompatible Changes
------------------------------
- The Google Cloud Storage configuration data supported by the acl, cors,
  and lifecycle commands now uses the JSON format instead of the older XML
  format. gsutil 4.0 will fail and provide conversion instructions if an XML
  configuration file is provided as an argument for a gs:// URL.
- gsutil no longer accepts arbitrary headers via the global -h flag.
  Documented headers for gsutil commands are still supported; for the
  full list of supported headers, see "gsutil help command_opts".
- The compose command will now default the destination object's
  Content-Type to the Content-Type of the first source object if none
  is provided via the -h global flag.
- The long-deprecated -t and -q options have been removed from the cp command.
- The perfdiag command no longer supports adding a host header.
- Having OAuth2 User Account credentials and OAuth2 Service Account
  credentials configured simultaneously will now fail with an error message
  to avoid confusion.  Also, a single invalid credential will fail with an
  error message.  See "gsutil help creds" for details.
- Bucket relocate scripts have been removed.
- Downloading object names ending with '/' is no longer supported to avoid
  problems this caused for directores using the Google Cloud Console.
- rm -r now implies rm -ra (removing all object versions recursively).
- All commands using the global -m option or a force option (such as
  rm -f or cp -c) will now return a non-zero exit code if there are any
  failures during the operation.
- MD5 and CRC32c values are now represented in base64 encoding instead
  of hex encoding (this includes manifest files).

New Features
------------
- The Google Cloud Storage JSON API (v1) is now the default API used
  by gsutil for all commands targeting gs:// URLs. The JSON API is more
  bandwidth efficient than the older XML API when transferring metadata
  and does not require separate calls to preserve object ACLs when copying.
  The XML API will automatically be used when accessing s3:// URLs.
- The Google Cloud Storage XML API can be used in lieu of the JSON API
  by setting 'prefer_api = xml' in the GSUtil section of your boto config file.
- Added the rsync command that can synchronize cloud and local directories.
- Added the signurl command that can generate Google Cloud Storage signed URLs.
- The perfdiag command now supports a listing latency test.
- The rb command now supports a -f flag allowing it to continue when errors
  are encountered.
- The test command now supports a -s flag that runs tests against S3.

Other Changes
-------------
- All python files not under a third_party directory are now pylint-clean,
  with the exception of TODO-format and a handful of warnings in root-level
  files. As part of the de-linting process, many edge-case bugs were
  identified and fixed.
- The ls command now operates depth-first (as in Unix ls) instead
  of breadth-first.
- Daisy-chain copying does not currently support resumable uploads.
- Several compatibility improvements for Windows and S3.


Release 3.42 (release-date: 2014-01-15)
=======================================

Other Changes
-------------

- Fixed potential bug with update command on CentOS.


Release 3.41 (release-date: 2014-01-14)
=======================================

Other Changes
-------------

- Changes to protect security of resumable upload IDs.


Release 3.40: Skipped

---------

- Fixed a bug where the no-op authentication handler was being loaded after
  other authentication plugins, causing the no-op handler to be chosen instead
  of other valid credentials.


Release 3.33 (release-date: 2013-07-16)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Added .git* to MANIFEST.in excludes and fixed cp doc typo. This was needed to
  overcome problem caused by accidental inclusion of .git* files in release,
  which caused the update command no longer to allow updates (since starting
  in 3.32 it checks whether the user has any extraneous files in the gsutil
  directory before updating)


Release 3.32 (release-date: 2013-07-16)
=======================================

New Features
------------

- Added support for getting and setting lifecycle configuration for buckets.

- Fixed incorrectly-generated password editing comment in service account
  config. Fixes #146.


Other Changes
-------------

- Improved flow when encounter auth failure for GCE service account with no
  configured storage scopes:
    1. Changed HasConfiguredCredentials() logic not to include
       has_auth_plugins as part of the evaluated expression, since that will
       always evaluate to true under GCE (since GCE configures its internal
       service account plugin under /etc/boto.cfg).
    2. Changed ConfigureNoOpAuthIfNeeded logic so we configure no-op auth
       plugin even if there is a config_file list, since GCE always configures
       /etc/boto.cfg, even if user has no storage scopes configured.
    3. Additional changes:
      a. Removed assertion of oauth access token cache check log from
         test_Doption.py, which may not be true sometimes (e.g., if user is
         using HMAC creds).
      b. Removed remnants of CONFIG_REQUIRED left over from earlier CL.
      c. Merged dupe _ConfigureNoOpAuthIfNeeded functions from two code files,
         moved to util.py.
- Fixed confusing gsutil rm "Omitting" message.
- Wrapped long gsutil update message.
- Silenced additional possible perfdiag errors.
- Improved perfdiag performance by only generating one chunk of random file.
- Changed to swallow broken pipe errors when piping gsutil to other programs.
- Made DotfulBucketNameNotUnderTld error message more user friendly.
- Extracted function for building ACL error text from main try/except loop,
  for better readability.

- Add note to gsutil update doc about auto-update checks being disabled with
  gsutil -q option.
- Disable hashing and increase buffer size in perfdiag.

- Move gslib/commands/cred_types.py to gslib, so only Command subclasses live
  in gslib/commands.
- Updated gsutil setmeta help no longer to warn that setmeta with versioning
  enabled creates a new object.


Release 3.26 (release-date: 2013-03-25)
=======================================

New Features
------------

- Added support for object composition.
- Added support for external service accounts.
- Changed gsutil to check for available updates periodically (only while
  stdin, stderr, stdout are connected to a TTY, so as not to interfere with
  cron jobs).
- Added chdefacl command.
- Made gsutil built-in help available under
  https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil

- Plumbed https_validate_certificates through to OAuth2 plugin handler,
  allowing control over cert validation for OAuth2 requests
- Fixed ISO 639.1 ref in config command help text

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug where gsutil cp -D didn't preserve metadata

- Fixed broken reference to boto_lib_dir in update command.
- Made changing ACL not retry on 400 error.
- Fixed name expansion bug for case where uri_strs is itself an iterator
  (issue #131); implemented additional naming unit test for this case.
- Fixed flaky gsutil rm test
- Fixed a bug in the chacl command that made it so you couldn't delete the
  AllAuthenticatedUsers group from an ACL.

Other Changes
-------------

  in the future.


Release 3.25 (release-date: 2013-02-21)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed two version-specific URI bugs:
    1. gsutil cp -r gs://bucket1 gs://bucket2 would create objects in bucket2
       with names corresponding to version-specific URIs in bucket1 (e.g.,
       gs://bucket2/obj#1361417568482000, where the "#1361417568482000" part was
       part of the object name, not the object's generation).

       This problem similarly caused gsutil cp -r gs://bucket1 ./dir to create
       files names corresponding to version-specific URIs in bucket1.
    2. gsutil rm -a gs://bucket/obj would attempt to delete the same object
       twice, getting a NoSuchKey error on the second attempt.


Release 3.24 (release-date: 2013-02-19)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug that caused attempt to dupe-encode a unicode filename.

Other Changes
-------------

- Refactored retry logic from setmeta and chacl to use @Retry decorator.
- Moved @Retry decorator to third_party.
- Fixed flaky tests.


Release 3.23 (release-date: 2013-02-16)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Make version-specific URI parsing more robust. This fixes a bug where
  listing buckets in certain cases would result in the error
  'BucketStorageUri' object has no attribute 'version_specific_uri'


Release 3.22 (release-date: 2013-02-15)
=======================================

New Features
------------

- Implemented new chacl command, which makes it easy to add and remove bucket
  and object ACL grants without having to edit XML (like the older setacl
  command).
- Implemented new "daisy-chain" copying mode, which allows cross-provider
  copies to run without buffering to local disk, and to use resumable uploads.
  This copying mode also allows copying between locations and between storage
  classes, using the new gsutil cp -D option. (Daisy-chain copying is the
  default when copying between providers, but must be explicitly requested for
  the other cases to keep costs and performance expectations clear.)
- Implemented new perfdiag command to run a diagnostic test against
  a bucket, collect system information, and report results. Useful
  when working with Google Cloud Storage team to resolve questions
  about performance.
- Added SIGQUIT (^\) handler, to allow breakpointing a running gsutil.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug where gsutil setwebcfg signature didn't match with
  HMAC authentication.
- Fixed ASCII codec decode error when constructing tracker filename
  from non-7bit ASCII input filename.
- Changed boto auth plugin framework to allow multiple plugins
  supporting requested capability, which fixes gsutil exception
  that used to happen where a GCE user had a service account
  configured and then ran gsutil config.
- Changed Command.Apply method to be resilient to name expansion
  exceptions. Before this change, if an exception was raised
  during iteration of NameExpansionResult, the parent process
  would immediately stop execution, causing the
  _EOF_NAME_EXPANSION_RESULT to never be sent to child processes.
  This resulted in the process hanging forever.
- Fixed various bugs for gsutil running on Windows:
  - Fixed various places from a hard-coded '/' to os.sep.
  - Fixed a bug in the cp command where it was using the destination
    URI's .delim property instead of the source URI.
  - Fixed a bug in the cp command's _SrcDstSame function by
    simplifying it to use os.path.normpath.
  - Fixed windows bug in tests/util.py _NormalizeURI function.
  - Fixed ZeroDivisionError sometimes happening during unit tests
    on Windows.

- Fixed gsutil rm bug that caused exit status 1 when encountered
  non-existent URI.
- Fixed support for gsutil cp file -.
- Added preconditions and retry logic to setmeta command, to
  enforce concurrency control.
- Fixed bug in copying subdirs to subdirs.
- Fixed cases where boto debug_level caused too much or too little
  logging:
  - resumable and one-shot uploads weren't showing response headers
    when connection.debug > 0.
  - payload was showing up in debug output when connection.debug
    < 4 for streaming uploads.

- Removed XML parsing from setacl. The previous implementation
  relied on loose XML handling, which could truncate what it sends
  to the service, allowing invalid XML to be specified by the
  user. Instead now the ACL XML is passed verbatim and we rely
  on server-side schema enforcement.
- Added user-agent header to resumable uploads.
- Fixed reporting bits/s when it was really bytes/s.
- Changed so we now pass headers with API version & project ID
  to create_bucket().
- Made "gsutil rm -r gs://bucket/folder" remove xyz_$folder$ object
  (which is created by various GUI tools).
- Fixed bug where gsutil binary was shipped with protection 750
  instead of 755.

Other Changes
-------------

- Reworked versioned object handling:
  - Removed need for commands to specify -v option to parse
    versions. Versioned URIs are now uniformly handled by all
    commands.
  - Refactored StorageUri parsing that had been split across
    storage_uri and convenience; made versioned URIs render with
    version string so StorageUri is round-trippable (boto change).
  - Implemented gsutil cp -v option for printing the version-specific
    URI that was just created.
  - Added error detail for attempt to delete non-empty versioned
    bucket. Also added versioning state to ls -L -b gs://bucket
    output.
  - Changed URI parsing to use pre-compiled regex's.
  - Other bug fixes.

- Rewrote/deepened/improved various parts of built-in help:
  - Updated 'gsutil help dev'.
  - Fixed help command handling when terminal does not have the
    number of rows set.
  - Rewrote versioning help.
  - Added gsutil help text for common 403 AccountProblem error.
  - Added text to 'gsutil help dev' about legal agreement needed
    with code submissions.
  - Fixed various other typos.
  - Updated doc for cp command regarding metadata not being
    preserved when copying between providers.
  - Fixed gsutil ls command documentation typo for the -L option.
  - Added HTTP scheme to doc/examples for gsutil setcors command.
  - Changed minimum version in documentation from 2.5 to 2.6 since
    gsutil no longer works in Python 2.5.
  - Cleaned up/clarify/deepen various other parts of gsutil
    built-in documentation.

- Numerous improvements to testing infrastructure:
  - Completely refactored infrastructure, allowing deeper testing
    and more readable test code, and enabling better debugging
    output when tests fail.
  - Moved gslib/test_*.py unit tests to gslib/tests module.
  - Made all tests (unit and integration, per-command and modules
    (like naming) run from single gsutil test command.
  - Moved TempDir functions from GsUtilIntegrationTestCase to
    GsUtilTestCase.
  - Made test runner message show the test function being run.
  - Added file path support to ObjectToURI function.
  - Disabled the test command if running on Python 2.6 and unittest2
    is not available instead of breaking all of gsutil.
  - Changed to pass GCS V2 API and project_id from boto config
    if necessary in integration_testcase#CreateBucket().
  - Fixed unit tests by using a GS-specific mocking class to
    override the S3 provider.
  - Added friendlier error message if test path munging fails.
  - Fixed bug where gsutil test only cleaned up first few test files.
  - Implemented setacl integration tests.
  - Implemented StorageUri parsing unit tests.
  - Implemented test for gsutil cp -D.
  - Implemented setacl integration tests.
  - Implemented tests for reading and seeking past end of file.
  - Implemented and tests for it in new tests module.
  - Changed cp tests that don't specify a Content-Type to check
    for new binary/octet-stream default instead of server-detected
    mime type.

- Changed gsutil mv to allow moving local files/dirs to the cloud.
  Previously this was disallowed in the belief we should be
  conservative about deleting data from local disk but there are
  legitimate use cases for moving data from a local dir to the
  cloud, it's clear to the user this would remove data from the
  local disk, and allowing it makes the tool behavior more
  consistent with what users would expect.
- Changed gsutil update command to insist on is_secure and
  https_validate_certificates.
- Fixed release no longer to include extraneous boto dirs in
  top-level of gsutil distribution (like bin/ and docs/).
- Changed resumable upload threshold from 1 MB to 2 MB.
- Removed leftover cloudauth and cloudreader dirs. Sample code
  now lives at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform.
- Updated copyright notice on code files.

  when server already has complete file, which resulted in an infinite
  loop that consumed 100% of the CPU.
- Fixed one more place that outputted progress info when gsutil cp -q
  specified (during streaming uploads).

Other Changes
-------------

- Updated help text for "gsutil help setmeta" and "gsutil help metadata", to

- Added info to built-in help for setmeta command, to explain the syntax
  needed when running from Windows.


Release 3.15 (release-date: 2012-08-12)
=======================================

New Features
------------

- Implemented gsutil setmeta command.
- Made gsutil understand bucket subdir conventions used by various tools
  (like GCS Manager and CloudBerry) so if you cp or mv to a subdir you
  created with one of those tools it will work as expected.
- Added support for Windows drive letter-prefaced paths when using Storage
  URIs.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed performance bug when downloading a large object with Content-

  and existing bucket subdir.
- Fixed bug that caused cross-provider copies into Google Cloud Storage to
  fail.
- Made change needed to make resumable transfer progress messages not print

- Fixed copy/paste error in config file documentation for
  https_validate_certificates option.
- Various typo fixes.

Other Changes
-------------

- Changed gsutil to unset http_proxy environment variable if it's set,
  because it confuses boto. (Proxies should instead be configured via the
  boto config file.)


Release 3.14 (release-date: 2012-07-28)
=======================================

New Features
------------

- Added cp -q option, to support quiet operation from cron jobs.

  get fp from src_key object. The real fix that's needed is described in
  https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues/72.

Other Changes
-------------

- Changed logging to print "Copying..." and Content-Type on same line;
  refactored content type and log handling.


Release 3.13 (release-date: 2012-07-19)
=======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Included the fix to make 'gsutil config' honor BOTO_CONFIG environment
  variable (which was intended to be included in Release 3.12)


Release 3.11 (release-date: 2012-06-28)
=======================================

New Features
------------

- Added support for configuring website buckets.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug that caused simultaneous resumable downloads of the same source
  object to use the same tracker file.
- Changed language code spec pointer from Wikipedia to loc.gov (for
  Content-Language header).


Release 3.10 (release-date: 2012-06-19)
=======================================

New Features
------------

- Added support for setting and listing Content-Language header.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug that caused getacl/setacl commands to get a character encoding
  exception when ACL content contained content not representable in ISO-8859-1
  character set.
- Fixed gsutil update not to fail under Windows exclusive file locking.
- Fixed gsutil ls -L to continue past 403 errors.
- Updated gsutil tests and also help dev with instructions on how to run
  boto tests, based on recent test refactoring done to in boto library.
- Cleaned up parts of cp help text.


Release 3.9 (release-date: 2012-05-24)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug that caused extra "file:/" to be included in pathnames with
  doing gsutil cp -R on Windows.


Release 3.8 (release-date: 2012-05-20)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed problem with non-ASCII filename characters not setting encoding before
  attempting to hash for generating resumable transfer filename.


Release 3.7 (release-date: 2012-05-11)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed handling of HTTPS tunneling through a proxy.


Release 3.6 (release-date: 2012-05-09)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug that caused wildcards spanning directories not to work.
- Fixed bug that gsutil cp -z not to find available tmp space correctly
  under Windows.


Release 3.5 (release-date: 2012-04-30)
======================================

Performance Improvement
-----------------------

- Change by Evan Worley to calculate MD5s incrementally during uploads and
  downloads. This reduces overall transfer time substantially for large
  objects.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug where uploading and moving multiple files to a bucket subdirectory
  didn't work as intended.
  (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues/92).
- Fixed bug where gsutil cp -r sourcedir didn't copy to specified subdir
  if there is only one file in sourcedir.
- Fixed bug where tracker file included a timestamp that caused it not to
  be recognized across sessions.
- Fixed bug where gs://bucket/*/dir wildcard matches too many objects.
- Fixed documentation errors in help associated with ACLs and projects.
- Changed GCS ACL parsing to be case-insensitive.
- Changed ls to print error and exit with non-0 status when wildcard matches
  nothing, to be more consistent with UNIX shell behavior.


Release 3.4 (release-date: 2012-04-06)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed problem where resumable uploads/downloads of objects with very long
  names would generate tracking files with names that exceeded local file
  system limits, making it impossible to complete resumable transfers for
  those objects. Solution was to build the tracking file name from a fixed
  prefix, SHA1 hash of the long filename, epoch timestamp and last 16
  chars of the long filename, which is guarantee to be a predictable and
  reasonable length.
- Fixed minor bug in output from 'gsutil help dev' which advised executing
  an inconsequential test script (test_util.py).


Release 3.3 (release-date: 2012-04-03)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed problem where gsutil ver and debug flags crashed when used
  with newly generated boto config files.
- Fixed gsutil bug in windows path handling, and make checksumming work
  across platforms.
- Fixed enablelogging to translate -b URI param to plain bucket name in REST
  API request.


Release 3.2 (release-date: 2012-03-30)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed problem where gsutil didn't convert between OS-specific directory
  separators when copying individually-named files (issue 87).
- Fixed problem where gsutil ls -R didn't work right if there was a key
  with a leading path (like /foo/bar/baz)


Release 3.1 (release-date: 2012-03-20)
======================================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Removed erroneous setting of Content-Encoding when a gzip file is uploaded
  (vs running gsutil cp -z, when Content-Encoding should be set). This
  error caused users to get gsutil.tar.gz file uncompressed by the user
  agent (like wget) while downloading, making the file appear to be of the
  wrong size/content.
- Fixed handling of gsutil help for Windows (previous code depended on
  termios and fcntl libs, which are Linux/MacOS-specific).


Release 3.0 (release-date: 2012-03-20)
======================================

Important Notes
---------------

- Backwards-incompatible wildcard change:
  The '*' wildcard now only matches objects within a bucket directory. If
  you have scripts that depend on being able to match spanning multiple
  directories you need to use '**' instead. For example, the command:

        gsutil cp gs://bucket/*.txt

  will now only match .txt files in the top-level directory.

        gsutil cp gs://bucket/**.txt

  will match across all directories.
- gsutil ls now lists one directory at a time. If you want to list all objects
  in a bucket, you can use:

        gsutil ls gs://bucket/**

  or:

        gsutil ls -R gs://bucket

New Features
------------

- Built-in help for all commands and many additional topics. Try
  "gsutil help" for a list of available commands and topics.
- A new hierarchical file tree abstraction layer, which makes the flat bucket
  name space look like a hierarchical file tree. This makes several things
  possible:
  - copying data to/from bucket sub-directories (see “gsutil help cp”).
  - distributing large uploads/downloads across many machines
    (see “gsutil help cp”)
  - renaming bucket sub-directories (see “gsutil help mv”).
  - listing individual bucket sub-directories and for listing directories
    recursively (see “gsutil help ls”).
  - setting ACLs for objects in a sub-directory (see “gsutil help setacl”).

- Support for per-directory (*) and recursive (**) wildcards. Essentially,
  ** works the way * did in previous gsutil releases, and * now behaves
  consistently with how it works in command interpreters (like bash). The
  ability to specify directory-only wildcards also enables a number of use
  cases, such as distributing large uploads/downloads by wildcarded name. See
  "gsutil help wildcards" for details.
- Support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration. See "gsutil
  help cors" for details.
- Support for multi-threading and recursive operation for setacl command
  (see “gsutil help setacl”).
- Ability to use the UNIX 'file' command to do content type recognition as
  an alternative to filename extensions.
- Introduction of new end-to-end test suite.
- The gsutil version command now computes a checksum of the code, to detect
  corruption and local modification when assisting with technical support.
- The gsutil update command is no longer beta/experimental, and now also
  supports updating from named URIs (for early/test releases).
- Changed gsutil ls -L to also print Content-Disposition header.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The gsutil cp -t option previously didn't work as documented, and instead
  Content-Type was always detected based on filename extension. Content-Type
  detection is now the default, the -t option is deprecated (to be removed in
  the future), and specifying a -h Content-Type header now correctly overrides
  the filename extension based handling. For details see "gsutil help
  metadata".
- Fixed bug that caused multi-threaded mv command not to percolate failures
  during the cp phase to the rm phase, which could under some circumstances
  cause data that was not copied to be deleted.
- Fixed bug that caused gsutil to use GET for ls -L requests. It now uses HEAD
  for ls -L requests, which is more efficient and faster.
- Fixed bug that caused gsutil not to preserve metadata during
  copy-in-the-cloud.
- Fixed bug that prevented setacl command from allowing DisplayName's in ACLs.
- Fixed bug that caused gsutil/boto to suppress consecutive slashes in path
  names.
- Fixed spec-non-compliant URI construction for resumable uploads.
- Fixed bug that caused rm -f not to work.
- Fixed UnicodeEncodeError that happened when redirecting gsutil ls output
  to a file with non-ASCII object names.

Other Changes
-------------

- UserAgent sent in HTTP requests now includes gsutil version number and OS
  name.
- Starting with this release users are able to get individual named releases
  from version-named objects: gs://pub/gsutil_<version>.tar.gz
  and gs://pub/gsutil_<version>.zip. The version-less counterparts
  (gs://pub/gsutil.tar.gz and gs://pub/gsutil.zip) will contain the latest
  release. Also, the gs://pub bucket is now publicly readable (so, anyone
  can list its contents).


Release 2.0 (release-date: 2012-01-13)
======================================

New Features
------------

- Support for for two new installation modes: enterprise and RPM.
  Customers can now install gsutil one of three ways:
  - Individual user mode (previously the only available mode): unpacking from
    a gzipped tarball (gs://pub/gsutil.tar.gz) or zip file
    (gs://pub/gsutil.zip) and running the gsutil command in place in the
    unpacked gsutil directory.
  - Enterprise mode (new): unpacking as above, and then running the setup.py
    script in the unpacked gsutil directory. This allows a systems
    administrator to install gsutil in a central location, using the Python
    distutils facility. This mode is supported only on Linux and MacOS.
  - RPM mode (new). A RedHat RPM can be built from the gsutil.spec.in file
    in the unpacked gsutil directory, allowing it to be installed as part of
    a RedHat build.

- Note: v2.0 is the first numbered gsutil release. Previous releases
  were given timestamps for versions. Numbered releases enable downstream
  package builds (like RPMs) to define dependencies more easily.
  This is also the first version where we began including release notes.
