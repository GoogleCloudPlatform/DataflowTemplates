def InitializeMultiprocessingVariables():
  """Initializes module-level variables that will be inherited by subprocesses.

  On Windows, a multiprocessing.Manager object should only
  be created within an "if __name__ == '__main__':" block. This function
  must be called, otherwise every command that calls Command.Apply will fail.

  While multiprocessing variables are initialized at the beginning of
  gsutil execution, new processes and threads are created only by calls
  to Command.Apply. When multiple processes and threads are used,
  the flow of startup/teardown looks like this:

  1. __main__: initializes multiprocessing variables, including any necessary
     Manager processes (here and in gslib.utils.parallelism_framework_util).
  2. __main__: Registers signal handlers for terminating signals responsible
     for cleaning up multiprocessing variables and manager processes upon exit.
  3. Command.Apply registers signal handlers for the main process to kill
     itself after the cleanup handlers registered by __main__ have executed.
  4. If worker processes have not been created for the current level of
     recursive calls, Command.Apply creates those processes.

  ---- Parallel operations start here, so steps are no longer numbered. ----
  - Command.Apply in the main thread starts the ProducerThread.
    - The Producer thread adds task arguments to the global task queue.
      - It optionally starts the SeekAheadThread which estimates total
        work for the Apply call.

  - Command.Apply in the main thread starts the UIThread, which will consume
    messages from the global status queue, process them, and display them to
    the user.

  - Each worker process creates a thread pool to perform work.
    - The worker process registers signal handlers to kill itself in
      response to a terminating signal.
    - The main thread of the worker process moves items from the global
      task queue to the process-local task queue.
    - Worker threads retrieve items from the process-local task queue,
      perform the work, and post messages to the global status queue.
    - Worker threads may themselves call Command.Apply.
      - This creates a new pool of worker subprocesses with the same size
        as the main pool. This pool is shared amongst all Command.Apply calls
        at the given recursion depth.
      - This reuses the global UIThread, global status queue, and global task
        queue.
      - This starts a new ProducerThread.
      - A SeekAheadThread is not started at this level; only one such thread
        exists at the top level, and it provides estimates for top-level work
        only.

  - The ProducerThread runs out of tasks, or the user signals cancellation.
    - The ProducerThread cancels the SeekAheadThread (if it is running) via
      an event.
    - The ProducerThread enqueues special terminating messages on the
      global task queue and global status queue, signaling the UI Thread to
      shut down and the main thread to continue operation.
    - In the termination case, existing processes exit in response to
      terminating signals from the main process.

  ---- Parallel operations end here. ----
  5. Further top-level calls to Command.Apply can be made, which will repeat
     all of the steps made in #4, except that worker processes will be
     reused.

      args: Command-line args (arg0 = actual arg, not command name ala bash).
      headers: Dictionary containing optional HTTP headers to pass to boto.
      debug: Debug level to pass in to boto connection (range 0..3).
      trace_token: Trace token to pass to the API implementation.
      parallel_operations: Should command operations be executed in parallel?
      bucket_storage_uri_class: Class to instantiate for cloud StorageUris.
                                Settable for testing/mocking.
      gsutil_api_class_map_factory: Creates map of cloud storage interfaces.

      logging_filters: Optional list of logging. Filters to apply to this
                       command's logger.
      command_alias_used: The alias that was actually used when running this
                          command (as opposed to the "official" command name,
                          which will always correspond to the file name).

          API calls.
      user_project: Project to be billed for this request.

    Implementation note: subclasses shouldn't need to define an __init__
    method, and instead depend on the shared initialization that happens
    here. If you do define an __init__ method in a subclass you'll need to
    explicitly call super().__init__(). But you're encouraged not to do this,
    because it will make changing the __init__ interface more painful.

    r"""Dispatches input arguments across a thread/process pool.

    Pools are composed of parallel OS processes and/or Python threads,
    based on options (-m or not) and settings in the user's config file.

    If only one OS process is requested/available, dispatch requests across
    threads in the current OS process.

    In the multi-process case, we will create one pool of worker processes for
    each level of the tree of recursive calls to Apply. E.g., if A calls
    Apply(B), and B ultimately calls Apply(C) followed by Apply(D), then we
    will only create two sets of worker processes - B will execute in the first,
    and C and D will execute in the second. If C is then changed to call
    Apply(E) and D is changed to call Apply(F), then we will automatically
    create a third set of processes (lazily, when needed) that will be used to
    execute calls to E and F. This might look something like:

    Pool1 Executes:                B
                                  / \
    Pool2 Executes:              C   D
                                /     \
    Pool3 Executes:            E       F

    Apply's parallelism is generally broken up into 4 cases:
    - If process_count == thread_count == 1, then all tasks will be executed
      by _SequentialApply.
    - If process_count > 1 and thread_count == 1, then the main thread will
      create a new pool of processes (if they don't already exist) and each of
      those processes will execute the tasks in a single thread.
    - If process_count == 1 and thread_count > 1, then this process will create
      a new pool of threads to execute the tasks.
    - If process_count > 1 and thread_count > 1, then the main thread will
      create a new pool of processes (if they don't already exist) and each of
      those processes will, upon creation, create a pool of threads to
      execute the tasks.

     Note that each thread will have its own instance of the calling class for
     context, and it will also have its own instance of a
     _SharedVariablesUpdater.  This is used in the following way:

     1. Before any tasks are performed, each thread will get a copy of the
        calling class, and the globally-consistent value of this shared variable
        will be initialized to whatever it was before the call to Apply began.

     2. After each time a thread performs a task, it will look at the current
        values of the shared variables in its instance of the calling class.

        2.A. For each such variable, it computes the delta of this variable
             between the last known value for this class (which is stored in
             a dict local to this class) and the current value of the variable
             in the class.

        2.B. Using this delta, we update the last known value locally as well
             as the globally-consistent value shared across all classes (the
             globally consistent value is simply increased by the computed
             delta).
