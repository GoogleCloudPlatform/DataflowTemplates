Note that if you use the Cloud SDK with any Google Cloud Platform products,
your use is additionally going to be governed by the license agreement or
terms of service, as applicable, of the underlying Google Cloud Platform
product with which you are using the Cloud SDK. For example, if you are
using the Cloud SDK with Google App Engine, your use would additionally be
governed by the Google App Engine Terms of Service.

This also means that if you were to create works that call Google APIs, you
would still need to agree to the terms of service (usually, Google's
Developer Terms of Service at https://developers.google.com/terms) for those
APIs separately, as this code does not grant you any special rights to use
the services.
