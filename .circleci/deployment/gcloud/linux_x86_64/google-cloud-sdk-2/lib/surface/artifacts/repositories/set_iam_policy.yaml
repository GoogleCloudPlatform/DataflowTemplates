      Set the IAM policy associated with an Artifact Registry repository.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * The repository specified does not exist.
        * The active account does not have permission to access the given
          repository's IAM policies.

    examples: |
      To set the IAM policy for `my-repository`, run:

        $ {command} my-repo policy.json

      See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
      policy file format and contents.
