    brief: Delete a membership.
    description: |
      This command deletes the Hub membership resource corresponding to the cluster.

      This command is intended to delete stale Hub Membership resources as doing so on a fully
      registered cluster will skip uninstalling the Connect Agent and and orphan in-cluster
      resources and agent connections to Google. To completely unregister the cluster, consider
      using the command: `{parent_command} unregister`.
