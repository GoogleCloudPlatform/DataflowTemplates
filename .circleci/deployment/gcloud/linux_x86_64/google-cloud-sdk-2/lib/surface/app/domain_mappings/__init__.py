  This set of commands can be used to view and manage your app's
  domain mappings.

  App Engine Domain Mappings allow an application to be served via one or many
  custom domains, such as `example.com`, instead of the default
  `https://<PROJECT-ID>.<REGION-ID>.r.appspot.com` address. You can use a
  custom domain with or without SSL.

  Use the AUTOMATIC management type to automatically provision an SSL
  certificate for your domain. Use the MANUAL management type to provide
  your own certificate or omit SSL.
