    brief: Set the IAM policy for a device registry.
    description: |
      This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a device registry, given
      a REGISTRY and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM
      policy. If the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the
      replacement will succeed only if the policy already in place matches that
      etag. (An etag obtained via $ gcloud iot registries get-iam-policy will
      prevent the replacement if the policy for the device registry has been
      subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not contain an etag value
      will replace any existing policy for the device registry.
    examples: |
      The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
      'policy.json' and set it for a device registry with identifier
      'my-registry'

        $ {command} --region=us-central1 my-registry policy.json

      See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
      policy file format and contents.
