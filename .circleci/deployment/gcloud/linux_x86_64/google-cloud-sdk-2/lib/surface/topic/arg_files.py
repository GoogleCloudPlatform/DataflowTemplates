          {description}

          All *gcloud firebase test android run* arguments may be specified by
          flags on the command line and/or via a YAML-formatted _ARG_FILE_. The
          optional, positional ARG_SPEC argument on the command line is used to
          specify a single _ARG_FILE_:_ARG_GROUP_NAME_ pair, where _ARG_FILE_ is
          the path to the YAML argument file, and _ARG_GROUP_NAME_ is the name
          of the argument group to load and parse. The _ARG_FILE_ must contain
          valid YAML syntax or gcloud will respond with an error.

          The basic format of a YAML argument file is:

            arg-group1:
              arg1: value1  # a comment
              arg2: value2
              ...

            # Another comment
            arg-group2:
              arg3: value3
              ...

          List arguments may be specified within square brackets:

            directories-to-pull: [/sdcard/dir1, /data/dir2]

          or by using the alternate YAML list notation with one dash per list
          item:

            ```
            directories-to-pull:
              - /sdcard/dir1
              - /data/dir2
            ```

          If a list argument only contains a single value, you may omit the
          square brackets:

            directories-to-pull: /sdcard/dir1

          Composition

          A special *include: [_ARG_GROUP1_, ...]* syntax allows merging or
          composition of argument groups (see *EXAMPLES* below). Included
          argument groups can *include:* other argument groups within the
          same YAML file, with unlimited nesting.

          Precedence

          An argument which appears on the command line has the highest
          precedence and will override the same argument if it is specified
          within an argument file.

          Any argument defined directly within a group will have higher
          precedence than an identical argument which is merged into that
          group using the *include:* keyword.

          Here are the contents of a very simple YAML argument file which
          we'll assume is stored in a file named excelsior_args.yaml:

            # Run a quick 'robo' test on the 'Excelsior' app for
            # 90 seconds using only the default Test Lab device.
            quick-robo-test:
              app: path/to/excelsior.apk
              type: robo
              max-steps: 100
              timeout: 90s
              async: true

          To invoke this test, run:

            $ gcloud firebase test android run excelsior_args.yaml:quick-robo-test

          To select which device(s) you wish to test against in an argument
          file, use *device:* to specify one or more devices, with each device
          having one or more dimensions. For example, to specify the LG G3
          device in the Chinese locale and with landscape orientation, use:

            single-device-group:
              device: [{model: g3, orientation: landscape, locale: zh}]

          To specify multiple devices, use any of the following equivalent YAML
          formats:

            multi-device-group1:
              device: [{model: flo}, {model: g3, version: 19, locale: zh}, {model: mako, version: 21}]

            multi-device-group2:
              device:
                - {model: flo}
                - {model: g3, version: 19, locale: zh}
                - {model: mako, version: 21}

            multi-device-group3:
              device:
                - model: flo
                - model: g3
                  version: 19
                  locale: zh
                - model: mako
                  version: 21

          If your app has a login screen, or has additional UI elements which
          require input text, you may specify the resource names of the Android
          target UI elements, along with their corresponding input values, in
          the 'robo-directives' map argument. You may also specify the elements
          which the Robo test should prioritize clicking. In the example below,
          "username_resource" is the resource name of the username field and
          "username" is the input for that field (similarly for password), and
          "signin_button_resource" is the resource name of the sign in button.

            # Run a 'robo' test on the 'Excelsior' app with login credentials.
            robo-test-with-login:
              app: path/to/excelsior.apk
              type: robo
              robo-directives:
                "text:username_resource": username
                "text:password_resource": password
                "click:sigin_button_resource": ""

          Assuming the above YAML text is appended to the arg-file named
          excelsior_args.yaml, you may invoke the test by running:

            $ gcloud firebase test android run excelsior_args.yaml:robo-test-with-login

          Here is a slightly more complicated example which demonstrates
          composition of argument groups using the legacy device dimension
          arguments (*device:* is now the preferred way to specify test
          devices). Assume the following YAML text is appended to the arg-file
          shown above named excelsior_args.yaml:

            # Specify some unit tests to be run against a test matrix
            # with one device type, two Android versions, and four
            # locales, for a total of eight test variations (1*2*4).
            unit-tests:
              type: instrumentation
              app: path/to/excelsior.apk
              test: path/to/excelsior-test.apk  # the unit tests
              timeout: 10m
              device-ids: NexusLowRes
              include: [supported-versions, supported-locales]

            supported-versions:
              os-version-ids: [21, 22]

            supported-locales:
              locales: [en, es, fr, it]

          To invoke this test matrix, run:

            $ gcloud firebase test android run excelsior_args.yaml:unit-tests

          To run these unit tests with the same locales and os-version-ids,
          but substituting a sampling of three physical Android devices
          instead of the single virtual NexusLowRes device, run:

            $ gcloud firebase test android run excelsior_args.yaml:unit-tests --device-ids shamu,htc_m8,g3

          In the last example, the --device-ids argument on the
          command line overrides the device-ids: specification inside the
          arg-file because command-line arguments have higher precedence.
