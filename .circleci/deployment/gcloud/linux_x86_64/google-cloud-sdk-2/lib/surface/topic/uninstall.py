  # Uninstalling Google Cloud SDK

  Note: For installations completed using an OS package (such as `apt-get`,
  `yum`, etc.), uninstall Cloud SDK via the OS package manager.

  Note: For Windows installations, execute the uninstaller.exe found under
  your Cloud SDK directory.

  To completely remove Cloud SDK, follow these instructions:

      * Locate your installation directory by running:

        $ gcloud info --format="value(installation.sdk_root)"

      * Locate your user config directory (typically `~/.config/gcloud`
        on MacOS and Linux) by running:

        $ gcloud info --format="value(config.paths.global_config_dir)"

      * Delete both these directories.

      * Additionally, remove lines sourcing `completion.bash.inc` and
        `paths.bash.inc` in your `.bashrc` or equivalent shell init file,
        if you added them during installation.

      * Review the contents of the `.boto` file in your home directory and
        remove the sections '[GoogleCompute]' and '[GSUtil]'. In addition,
        review the sections '[OAuth2]' and '[Credentials]' for settings that
        are no longer needed.
