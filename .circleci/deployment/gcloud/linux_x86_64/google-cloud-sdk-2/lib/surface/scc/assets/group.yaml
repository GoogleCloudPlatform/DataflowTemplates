    description: Filter an organization's assets and groups them by their specified properties.
    examples: |
      Group assets under organization 123456 by their type (e.g. project, disk, compute instance, service etc):

        $ {command} 123456 --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_type"

      Group compute instances (assets) under organization 123456 by their respective projects:

        $ {command} 123456 --filter="security_center_properties.resource_type=\"google.compute.Instance\"" --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_project"

      Group assets that were updated on or after 2019-01-01T01:00:00 GMT by their types.

        $ {command} 123456 --filter="update_time >= 1546304400000" --group-by="security_center_properties.resource_type"

      Group assets into following 3 state_changes (ADDED/DELETED/ACTIVE) based on the activity during past 24 hours:

        $ {command} 123456 --compare-duration=86400s --group-by="state_change"

  arguments:

    resource:
      help_text: Refers to the source whose assets should be grouped by.
      override_resource_collection: true
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.scc.resources:organization

    params:
    - arg_name: group-by
      api_field: groupAssetsRequest.groupBy
      help_text: |
        Expression that defines what asset fields to use for grouping (including 'state').
        String value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields.
        For example: "parent,resource_name". The following fields are supported:
        * security_center_properties.resource_project
        * security_center_properties.resource_type
        * security_center_properties.resource_parent
        * state_change
    - arg_name: read-time
      api_field: groupAssetsRequest.readTime
      help_text: |
        Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. Filter is limited
        to assets existing at the supplied time and their values are those at that
        specific time. For example: 2019-02-28T07:00:00Z. Absence of this field will
        default to the API's version of NOW.
    - arg_name: compare-duration
      api_field: groupAssetsRequest.compareDuration
      help_text: |
        GroupAssetsResult's "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time.
        Example duration: "100000s"
    - arg_name: filter
      api_field: groupAssetsRequest.filter
      help_text: |
        Expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators
        'AND' and 'OR'. Parentheses are not supported, and 'OR' has higher precedence than
        'AND'. For example, 'update_time > 100 AND
        security_center_properties.resource_type=\"google.cloud.resourcemanager.Organization\"'
        is a valid filter string.
    - arg_name: page-size
      api_field: groupAssetsRequest.pageSize
      help_text: |
        The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is
        10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
    - arg_name: page-token
      api_field: groupAssetsRequest.pageToken
      help_text: |
        Value returned by the last 'GroupAssetsResponse'; indicates
        that this is a continuation of a prior 'GroupAssets' call, and that the
        system should return the next page of data.
