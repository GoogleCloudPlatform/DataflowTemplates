        The gcloud compute command group lets you create, configure, and
        manipulate Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances.

        With Compute Engine, you can create and run VMs
        on Google's infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance,
        and value that lets you launch large compute clusters on
        Google's infrastructure.

        For more information about Compute Engine, see the
        [Compute Engine overview](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
        and the
        [Compute Engine user documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/).
