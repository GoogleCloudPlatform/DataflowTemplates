  help_text:
    brief: Set the IAM policy for a Cloud Pub/Sub Subscription.
    description: |
      This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a subscription, given a
      subscription and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM
      policy.

      If the given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the
      replacement will succeed only if the policy already in place matches that
      etag. (An etag obtained via `get-iam-policy` will prevent the replacement
      if the policy for the subscription has been subsequently updated.) A
      policy file that does not contain an etag value will replace any existing
      policy for the subscription.
    examples: |
      The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
      `policy.json` and set it for a subscription `my-sub`

        $ {command} my-sub policy.json

       See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
       the policy file format and contents.
