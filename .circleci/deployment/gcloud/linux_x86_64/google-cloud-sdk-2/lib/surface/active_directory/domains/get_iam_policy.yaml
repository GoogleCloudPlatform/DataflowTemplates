      Describe the IAM policy for a Managed Microsoft AD domain.
    description: |
      *{command}* displays the IAM policy associated with an Managed Microsoft AD domain.
      If formatted as JSON, the output can be edited and used as
      a policy file for *set-iam-policy*. The output includes an "etag"
      field identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
      concurrent policy updates.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * The domain specified does not exist.
        * The active account does not have permission to access the given
          domain's IAM policies.

      To print the IAM policy for `my-domain.com`, run:

        $ {command} my-domain.com
