      Create a Managed Microsoft AD domain.
    description: |
      Create a new Managed Microsoft AD domain with the given name using Google Cloud's
      Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * An AD domain with the same name already exists.
        * The active account does not have permission to create AD domains.
        * There is an overlap between the provided CIDR range and authorized network's CIDR.
        * A valid region was not provided.
    examples: |
      The following command creates an AD domain with the name
      `my-domain.com` in region `us-central1`, a network peering to `my-network` and
      consuming the IP address range `10.172.0.0/24`.

        $ {command} my-domain.com --region=us-central1 --reserved-ip-range="10.172.0.0/24"
        --authorized-networks=projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network
