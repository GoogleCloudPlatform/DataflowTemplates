      Delete a worker pool from a specified instance.
    description: |
      Delete a worker pool from a specified instance.
    examples: |
      The following command deletes the workerpool called 'pool' from the instance called
      'default_instance':

        $ {command} pool --instance=default_instance

      Rather than passing the worker pool and instance as separate parameters, you can pass the
      worker pool as a resource, like so:

        $ {command} projects/{projectId}/instance/default_instance/workerpools/pool

      where {projectId} is the ID of the Cloud Platform project that contains the instance.

  request:
    collection: remotebuildexecution.projects.instances.workerpools

  async:
    collection: remotebuildexecution.projects.operations

  arguments:
    resource:
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.remote_build_execution.resources:workerpool
      help_text: |
        Arguments and parameters that specify the worker pool to delete.
