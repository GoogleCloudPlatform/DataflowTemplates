  *{command}* provides an enhanced *bash*(1) command line with features that
  include:
  {features}

  ### Display

  The *{command}* display window is divided into sections, described here
  from top to bottom.

  *Previous Output*::

  Command output scrolls above the command input section as commands are
  executed.

  *Command Input*::

  Commands are typed, completed, and edited in this section. The default prompt
  is "$ ". If a context has been set, then its tokens are prepopulated before
  the cursor.

  *Active Help*::

  As you type, this section displays in-line help summaries for commands, flags,
  and arguments. You can toggle active help on and off via the *F2* key.
  Hit *F8* to display the help text in your browser.

  *Status Display*::

  Current *gcloud* project and account information, and function key
  descriptions and settings are displayed in this section. Function keys
  toggle mode/state settings or run specific actions.
  {bindings}

  ### Auto and Tab Completion

  Command completions are displayed in a scrolling pop-up menu. Use `tab` and
  up/down keys to navigate the completions, and `space` or `/` to select the
  highlighted completion.

  Completions for _known_ commands, flags, and static flag values are displayed
  automatically. Positional and dynamic flag value completions for known
  commands are displayed after `tab` is entered. Known commands include
  `gcloud`, `bq`, `gsutil`, `kubectl`, and any command with a man page that has
  been executed at least once in any *interactive* session.

  `tab` completion for unknown commands defers to *bash*(1), while still using
  the *interactive* user interface. Absent specific command information, a
  file/path completer is used when `tab` is entered for unknown positionals
  (arguments that do not start with '-'). The default completer handles '~' path
  notation and embedded _$var_ references, but does not expand their values in
  completions.

  Configure bash completions as you normally would. *{command}* starts up bash
  in a mode that sources *~/.bashrc* with the environment variable
  *COSHELL_VERSION* set to a non-empty version value.

  Command completion resets with each simple command in the command line. Simple
  commands are separated by '|', ';', '&' and may appear after '$(', '(', '{',
  '!', *if*, *then*, *elif*, *while*, and _name_=_value_ per command exports.
  Use `tab` on an empty line to enable command executable search on PATH for
  the first token in each simple command.

  Currently simple and compound commands must be entered in a single line.

  Refer to
  [Using gcloud interactive](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/interactive-gcloud)
  for more information and animated GIFs.

  ### Control Characters

  Control characters affect the currently running command or the current
  command line being entered at the prompt.

  *ctrl-c*::
  If a command is currently running, then that command is interrupted. This
  terminates the command. Otherwise, if no command is running, ctrl-c clears
  the current command line.

  *ctrl-d*::
  Exits when entered as the first character at the command prompt. You can
  also run the *exit* command at the prompt.

  *ctrl-w*::
  If a command is not currently running, then the last word on the command
  line is deleted. This is handy for "walking back" partial completions.

  ### Command history

  *{command}* maintains persistent command history across sessions.

  #### emacs mode

  *^N*:: Move ahead one line in the history.
  *^P*:: Move back one line in the history.
  *^R*:: Search backwards in the history.

  #### vi mode

  /:: Search backwards in the history.
  *j*:: Move ahead one line in the history.
  *k*:: Move back one line in the history.
  *n*:: Search backwards for the next match.
  *N*:: Search forwards for the next match.

  #### history search mode

  *ENTER/RETURN*:: Retrieve the matched command line from the history.
  *^R*:: Search backwards for the next match.
  *^S*:: Search forwards for the next match.

  ### Layout Configuration

  Parts of the layout are configurable via
  *$ gcloud config set* interactive/_property_. These properties are only
  checked at startup. You must exit and restart to see the effects of new
  settings.
  {properties}

  ### CLI Trees

  *{command}* uses CLI tree data files for typeahead, command line completion,
  and help snippet generation. A few CLI trees are installed with their
  respective Cloud SDK components: *gcloud* (core component), *bq*, *gsutil*,
  and *kubectl*. Trees for commands that have man(1) pages are generated on
  the fly. See `$ gcloud topic cli-trees` for details.

  ## EXAMPLES

  To set the command context of *{command}* to "gcloud ", run:

      {command} --context="gcloud "

  ## NOTES

  On Windows, install *git*(1) for a *bash*(1) experience. *{command}* will
  then use the *git* (MinGW) *bash* instead of *cmd.exe*.

  Please run *$ gcloud feedback* to report bugs or request new features.
