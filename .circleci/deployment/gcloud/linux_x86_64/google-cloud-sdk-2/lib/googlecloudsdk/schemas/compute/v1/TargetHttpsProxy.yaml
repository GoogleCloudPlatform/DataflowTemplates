      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a
      dash.

  quicOverride:
    description: |-
      Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy resource.
      This setting determines whether the load balancer attempts to negotiate
      QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. - When quic-
      override is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is used.  - When
      quic-override is set to ENABLE, the load balancer uses QUIC when possible.
      - When quic-override is set to DISABLE, the load balancer doesn't use
      QUIC.  - If the quic-override flag is not specified, NONE is implied. -
