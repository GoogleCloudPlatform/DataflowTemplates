      type: string
  autoDelete:
    description: |-
      Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the instance is
      deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the instance).
    type: boolean
  boot:
    description: |-
      Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the first
      partition of the disk for its root filesystem.
    type: boolean
  deviceName:
    description: |-
      Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is reflected into the
      /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating system running within
      the instance. This name can be used to reference the device for mounting,
      resizing, and so on, from within the instance. If not specified, the
      server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk, in the form
      persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned by Google Compute Engine.
      This field is only applicable for persistent disks.
    type: string
  diskEncryptionKey:
    description: |-
      Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.  If
      you are creating a new disk, this field encrypts the new disk using an
      encryption key that you provide. If you are attaching an existing disk
      that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk using the
      customer-supplied encryption key.  If you encrypt a disk using a customer-
      supplied key, you must provide the same key again when you attempt to use
      this resource at a later time. For example, you must provide the key when
      you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or when you attach the
      disk to a virtual machine instance.  If you do not provide an encryption
      key, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key
      and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.  Instance
      templates do not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so you cannot
      use your own keys to encrypt disks in a managed instance group.
    $ref: CustomerEncryptionKey.yaml
  diskSizeGb:
    description: The size of the disk in GB.
    type: string
  guestOsFeatures:
    description: |-
      A list of features to enable on the guest operating system. Applicable
      only for bootable images. Read  Enabling guest operating system features
      to see a list of available options.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: GuestOsFeature.yaml
  index:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] A zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved for
      the boot disk. If you have many disks attached to an instance, each
      disk would have a unique index number.
    type: integer
  initializeParams:
    description: |-
      [Input Only] Specifies the parameters for a new disk that will be
      created alongside the new instance. Use initialization parameters to
      create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new instance.  This
      property is mutually exclusive with the source property; you can only
      define one or the other, but not both.
    $ref: AttachedDiskInitializeParams.yaml
  interface:
    description: |-
      Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, which is
      either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always
      use SCSI and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a
      persistent disk in any other format than SCSI. Local SSDs can use
      either NVME or SCSI. For performance characteristics of SCSI over
      NVMe, see Local SSD performance. TODO(b/131765817): Update
      documentation when NVME is supported.
    type: string
    enum:
    - NVME
    - SCSI
  kind:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#attachedDisk for
      attached disks.
    type: string
  licenses:
    description: '[Output Only] Any valid publicly visible licenses.'
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  mode:
    description: |-
      The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or
      READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in
      READ_WRITE mode.
    type: string
    enum:
    - READ_ONLY
    - READ_WRITE
  source:
    description: |-
      Specifies a valid partial or full URL to an existing Persistent
      Disk resource. When creating a new instance, one of
      initializeParams.sourceImage or initializeParams.sourceSnapshot or
      disks.source is required except for local SSD.  If desired, you
      can also attach existing non-root persistent disks using this
      property. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.
      Note that for InstanceTemplate, specify the disk name, not the URL
      for the disk.
    type: string
  type:
    description: |-
      Specifies the type of the disk, either SCRATCH or PERSISTENT. If
      not specified, the default is PERSISTENT.
    type: string
    enum:
    - PERSISTENT
    - SCRATCH
