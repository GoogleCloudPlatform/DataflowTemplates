  defaultRouteAction:
    description: |-
      defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load
      balancer performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header
      transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected
      backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set,
      defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Only one of
      defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.

  defaultService:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to which traffic is
      directed if none of the hostRules match. If defaultRouteAction is
      additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc.
      take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if
      defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of
      defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect  or
      defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    type: string
  defaultUrlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When none of the specified hostRules match, the request is redirected to a
      URL specified by defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified,

    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following

      character, which cannot be a dash.
