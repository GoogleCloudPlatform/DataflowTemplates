    description: |-
      Specifies a non-zero timeout per retry attempt. If not specified, will use

  retryConditions:
    description: |-
      Specfies one or more conditions when this retry rule applies. Valid values
      are:   - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service
      responds with any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not
      respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection
      failure, and refused streams.  - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only
      applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504. -  - connect-failure:
      Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services, for
      example due to connection timeouts.  - retriable-
