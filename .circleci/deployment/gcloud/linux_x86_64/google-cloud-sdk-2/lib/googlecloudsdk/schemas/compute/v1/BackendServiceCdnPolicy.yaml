      Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be
      considered fresh. After this time period, the response will be revalidated
      before being served. Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to
      signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all
      responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]"
      header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual
      headers served in responses will not be altered.
