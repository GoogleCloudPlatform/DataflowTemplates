    baz:
      - e: f

    The first uses a custom constructor to insert data into your current file,
    so:

    bar: !COMMON foo.a

    results in:

    bar: b

    The second mechanism overrides construct_mapping and construct_sequence to
    post process the data and replace the merge macro with keys from the other
    file. We can't use the custom constructor for this as well because the
    merge key type in yaml is processed before custom constructors which makes
    importing and merging not possible. So:

    bar:
      _COMMON_: foo
      i: j

    results in:

    bar:
      a: b

    results in:

    bar:
      - e: f
      - g: h

    You may also use the !REF and _REF_ directives in the same way. Instead of
    pulling from the common file, they can pull from an arbitrary yaml file
    somewhere in the googlecloudsdk tree. The syntax looks like:

    bar: !REF googlecloudsdk.foo.bar:a.b.c

    This will load googlecloudsdk/foo/bar.yaml and from that file return the
