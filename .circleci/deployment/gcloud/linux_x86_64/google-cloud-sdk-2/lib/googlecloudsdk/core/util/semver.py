"""Helper functions for comparing semantic versions.

Basic rules of semver:

Format: major.minor.patch-prerelease+build

major, minor, patch, must all be present and integers with no leading zeros.
They are compared numerically by segment.

prerelease is an optional '.' separated series of identifiers where each is
either an integer with no leading zeros, or an alphanumeric string
(including '-'). Prereleases are compared by comparing each identifier in
order.  Integers are compared numerically, alphanumeric strings are compared
lexigraphically.  A prerelease version is lower precedence than it's associated
normal version.

The build number is optional and not included in the comparison.  It is '.'
separated series of alphanumeric identifiers.

Two SemVer objects are considered equal if they represent the exact same string
(including the build number and including case differences).  For comparison
operators, we follow the SemVer spec of precedence and ignore the build number
and case of alphanumeric strings.
