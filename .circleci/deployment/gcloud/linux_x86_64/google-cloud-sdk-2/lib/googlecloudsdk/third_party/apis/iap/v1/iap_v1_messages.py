  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",

  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable
  access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression:
  request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= -
  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

      evaluate to false. This field is in limited use. If your intended use
      case is not expected to express resource.labels attribute in IAM
      Conditions, leave this field empty. Before planning on using this

    name: Name of the resource on which conditions will be evaluated. Must use
      the Relative Resource Name of the resource, which is the URI path of the
      resource without the leading "/". Examples are
      "projects/_/buckets/[BUCKET-ID]" for storage buckets or
      "projects/[PROJECT-ID]/global/firewalls/[FIREWALL-ID]" for a firewall.
      This field is required for evaluating conditions with rules on resource
      names. For a `list` permission check, the resource.name value must be
      set to the parent resource. If the parent resource is a project, this
      field should be left unset.
    service: The name of the service this resource belongs to. It is
      configured using the official_service_name of the Service as defined in
      service configurations under //configs/cloud/resourcetypes. For example,
      the official_service_name of cloud resource manager service is set as
      'cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com' according to
      //configs/cloud/resourcetypes/google/cloud/resourcemanager/prod.yaml
    type: The public resource type name of the resource on which conditions
      will be evaluated. It is configured using the official_name of the
      ResourceType as defined in service configurations under
      //configs/cloud/resourcetypes. For example, the official_name for GCP
      projects is set as 'cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project'
      according to
      //configs/cloud/resourcetypes/google/cloud/resourcemanager/prod.yaml For
      details see go/iam-conditions-integration-guide.
