          "description": "`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.",

Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: * name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time = \"2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00\"` `update_time = 1560208038000` * create_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string.
