        can be: - 'self' (i.e., allow connections from clients that are in the

    LabelsValue: Labels describing the operation. Only the following labels
      are allowed: - Labels describing monitored resources as defined in the
      service configuration. - Default labels of metric values. When
      specified, labels defined in the metric value override these default. -
      The following labels defined by Google Cloud Platform: -
      `cloud.googleapis.com/location` describing the location where the
      operation happened, - `servicecontrol.googleapis.com/user_agent`
      describing the user agent of the API request, -
      `servicecontrol.googleapis.com/service_agent` describing the service
      used to handle the API request (e.g. ESP), -
      `servicecontrol.googleapis.com/platform` describing the platform where
      the API is served, such as App Engine, Compute Engine, or Kubernetes
      Engine.
    UserLabelsValue: User defined labels for the resource that this operation
      is associated with. Only a combination of 1000 user labels per consumer
      project are allowed.

  Fields:
    consumerId: Identity of the consumer who is using the service. This field
      should be filled in for the operations initiated by a consumer, but not
      for service-initiated operations that are not related to a specific
      consumer. - This can be in one of the following formats: -
      project:PROJECT_ID, - project`_`number:PROJECT_NUMBER, -
      projects/PROJECT_ID or PROJECT_NUMBER, - folders/FOLDER_NUMBER, -
      organizations/ORGANIZATION_NUMBER, - api`_`key:API_KEY.
    endTime: End time of the operation. Required when the operation is used in
      ServiceController.Report, but optional when the operation is used in
      ServiceController.Check.
    extensions: Unimplemented.
    importance: DO NOT USE. This is an experimental field.
    labels: Labels describing the operation. Only the following labels are
      allowed: - Labels describing monitored resources as defined in the
      service configuration. - Default labels of metric values. When
      specified, labels defined in the metric value override these default. -
      The following labels defined by Google Cloud Platform: -
      `cloud.googleapis.com/location` describing the location where the

      `servicecontrol.googleapis.com/platform` describing the platform where
      the API is served, such as App Engine, Compute Engine, or Kubernetes
      Engine.
    logEntries: Represents information to be logged.
    metricValueSets: Represents information about this operation. Each
      MetricValueSet corresponds to a metric defined in the service
      configuration. The data type used in the MetricValueSet must agree with
      the data type specified in the metric definition. Within a single
      operation, it is not allowed to have more than one MetricValue instances
      that have the same metric names and identical label value combinations.
      If a request has such duplicated MetricValue instances, the entire
      request is rejected with an invalid argument error.
    operationId: Identity of the operation. This must be unique within the
      scope of the service that generated the operation. If the service calls
      Check() and Report() on the same operation, the two calls should carry
      the same id. UUID version 4 is recommended, though not required. In
      scenarios where an operation is computed from existing information and
      an idempotent id is desirable for deduplication purpose, UUID version 5
      is recommended. See RFC 4122 for details.
    operationName: Fully qualified name of the operation. Reserved for future
      use.
    quotaProperties: Represents the properties needed for quota check.
      Applicable only if this operation is for a quota check request. If this
      is not specified, no quota check will be performed.
    resources: The resources that are involved in the operation. The maximum
      supported number of entries in this field is 100.
    startTime: Required. Start time of the operation.
    traceSpans: Unimplemented. A list of Cloud Trace spans. The span names
      shall contain the id of the destination project which can be either the
      produce or the consumer project.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    iamOwned: A boolean attribute.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

  to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the
  end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for its sub-operations. A trace
  can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to
  be contiguous-there may be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.

  Enums:
    SpanKindValueValuesEnum: Distinguishes between spans generated in a
      particular context. For example, two spans with the same name may be
      distinguished using `CLIENT` (caller) and `SERVER` (callee) to identify
      an RPC call.

  Fields:
    attributes: A set of attributes on the span. You can have up to 32
      attributes per span.
    childSpanCount: An optional number of child spans that were generated
      while this span was active. If set, allows implementation to detect
      missing child spans.
    displayName: A description of the span's operation (up to 128 bytes).
      Stackdriver Trace displays the description in the Google Cloud Platform
      Console. For example, the display name can be a qualified method name or
      a file name and a line number where the operation is called. A best
      practice is to use the same display name within an application and at
      the same call point. This makes it easier to correlate spans in
      different traces.
    endTime: The end time of the span. On the client side, this is the time
      kept by the local machine where the span execution ends. On the server
      side, this is the time when the server application handler stops
      running.
    name: The resource name of the span in the following format:
      projects/[PROJECT_ID]/traces/[TRACE_ID]/spans/SPAN_ID is a unique
      identifier for a trace within a project; it is a 32-character
      hexadecimal encoding of a 16-byte array. [SPAN_ID] is a unique
      identifier for a span within a trace; it is a 16-character hexadecimal
      encoding of an 8-byte array.
    parentSpanId: The [SPAN_ID] of this span's parent span. If this is a root
      span, then this field must be empty.
    sameProcessAsParentSpan: (Optional) Set this parameter to indicate whether
      this span is in the same process as its parent. If you do not set this
      parameter, Stackdriver Trace is unable to take advantage of this helpful
      information.
    spanId: The [SPAN_ID] portion of the span's resource name.
    spanKind: Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context.
      For example, two spans with the same name may be distinguished using
      `CLIENT` (caller) and `SERVER` (callee) to identify an RPC call.
    startTime: The start time of the span. On the client side, this is the
      time kept by the local machine where the span execution starts. On the
      server side, this is the time when the server's application handler
      starts running.
