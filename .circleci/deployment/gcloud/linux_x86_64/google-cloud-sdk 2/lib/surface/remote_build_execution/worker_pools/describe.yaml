    brief: |
      Describe a worker pool.
    description: |
      Display the configuration of the specified worker pool.  Shows the current state of the
      worker pool, how many workers are in the pool, as well as the machine configuration for
      those workers (the Compute Engine machine-type as well as disk size).
    examples: |
      The following command describes the worker pool called 'pool' from the instance called
      'default_instance':

        $ {command} pool --instance=default_instance

      Rather than passing the worker pool and instance as separate parameters you can pass the
      worker pool as a resource, like so:

        $ {command} projects/{projectId}/instance/default_instance/workerpools/pool

      where {projectId} is the ID of the Cloud Platform project that contains the instance.
