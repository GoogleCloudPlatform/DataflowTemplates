  description: |
   Performs a check on whether a member is granted a
   permission on a resource and how that access is determined according to
   the resource's effective IAM policy interpretation.

  ALPHA:
    examples: |
      To troubleshoot a permission of a member on a resource, run:

        $ {command} //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/project-id
        --principal-email=my-iam-account@somedomain.com
        --permission=resourcemanager.projects.get

      See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies for more information about
      IAM policies.

      To troubleshoot a permission of a member on a resource with conditional binding, run:

        $ {command} //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/project-id \
        --principal-email=my-iam-account@somedomain.com \
        --permission=resourcemanager.projects.get \
        --resource-name=//compute.googleapis.com/projects/{project-id}/global/images/{image-id}'\
        --resource-service='compute.googleapis.com' \
        --resource-type='compute.googleapis.com/Image' \
        --destination-ip='192.2.2.2'--destination-port=8080 --request-time='2021-01-01T00:00:00Z'
