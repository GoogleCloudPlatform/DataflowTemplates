  brief: |
    Create a Cloud OAuth brand for the project.
  description: |
    *{command}* is used to create a Cloud OAuth brand for the project. The brand is 'internal only',
    meaning OAuth clients created under it only accept requests from users who belong to the same
    G Suite account as the project. The brand is created in unreviewed status. Your domain will not
    appear on the OAuth consent screen until it is reviewed after you manually start a review
    process in Google Cloud Platform Console. Note that the
    'internal only' setting can be manually changed in Google Cloud Platform Console
    (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). A project can only have one brand.
