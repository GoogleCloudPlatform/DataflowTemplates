    brief: Get transcripts of longer audio from an audio file.
    description: |
      Get a transcript of audio up to 80 minutes in length. If the audio is
      under 60 seconds, you may also use `{parent_command} recognize` to
      analyze it.
    examples: |
      To block the command from completing until analysis is finished, run:

        $ {command} AUDIO_FILE --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE

      You can also receive an operation as the result of the command by running:

        $ {command} AUDIO_FILE --language-code=LANGUAGE_CODE --sample-rate=SAMPLE_RATE --async

      This will return information about an operation. To get information about the
      operation, run:

        $ {parent_command} operations describe OPERATION_ID

      To poll the operation until it's complete, run:

        $ {parent_command} operations wait OPERATION_ID

  request:
    collection: speech.speech
    method: longrunningrecognize
    api_version: v1

  async:
    collection: speech.operations
