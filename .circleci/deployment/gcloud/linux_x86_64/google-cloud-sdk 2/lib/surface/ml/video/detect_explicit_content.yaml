    brief: Detect explicit content in videos.
    description: |
      Detect adult content within a video. Adult content is content generally
      appropriate for 18 years of age and older, including but not limited to
      nudity, sexual activities, and pornography (including cartoons or anime).

      The response includes a bucketized likelihood value, from VERY_UNLIKELY to
      VERY_LIKELY. When Explicit Content Detection evaluates a video, it does so on
      a per-frame basis and considers visual content only (not audio).
    examples: |
      To detect explicit content in a video file named 'gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4', run the following command.:

        $ {command} gs://my_bucket/input_file.mp4
