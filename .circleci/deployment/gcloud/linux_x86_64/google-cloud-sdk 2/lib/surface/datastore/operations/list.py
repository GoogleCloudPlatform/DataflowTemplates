  Filters are case-sensitive and have the following syntax:

    field = value [AND [field = value]] ...

  where `field` is one of `kind`, `namespace`, `type`, or `labels.[KEY]`, and
  `[KEY]` is a label key. `kind` and `namespace` may be `*` to query for
  operations on all kinds and/or all namespaces. `type` may be one of
  `export_entities` or `import_entities`.

  Only the logical `AND` operator is
  supported; space-separated items are treated as having an implicit `AND`
  operator.

  ## EXAMPLES

  To see the list of all operations, run:

    $ {command}

  To see the list of all export operations, run:

    $ {command} --filter='type:export_entities'

  To see the list of all export operations for kind 'MyKind', run:

    $ {command} --filter='type:export_entities AND kind:MyKind'

  To see the list of all operations with particular labels, run:

    $ {command} --filter='labels.run = daily'
