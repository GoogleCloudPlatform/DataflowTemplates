        Cancel a running operation.

Cancel is a best-effort method for aborting a running operation. Operations that
have already completed can not be cancelled. If the operation has passed the
"point of no-return", cancel will have no effect.

An example of "point of no-return" in the context of Upgrade operations would
be if all the nodes have been upgraded but the operation hasn't been marked as
complete.
