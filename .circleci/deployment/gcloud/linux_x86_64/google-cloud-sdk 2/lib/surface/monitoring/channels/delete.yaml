    brief: Delete a notification channel.
    description: |
      Delete a notification channel.

      ## EXAMPLES
      The following command will delete channel `projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890`, but
      only if the channel is not actively referenced by existing alerting policies:

        $ {command} "projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890"

      The following command will delete channel `projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890`, even
      if the channel is still actively referenced by alerting policies; if an existing policy
      references the channel, it will be modified as a side-effect to remove the channel.

        $ {command} "projects/12345/notificationChannels/67890" --force

  request:
    collection: monitoring.projects.notificationChannels

  arguments:
    resource:
      help_text: The notification channel to delete.
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.monitoring.resources:notification_channel
    params:
    - arg_name: force
      api_field: force
      action: store_true
      help_text: If true, the notification channel will be deleted regardless of its
        use in alerting policies (the policies will be updated to remove the channel).
