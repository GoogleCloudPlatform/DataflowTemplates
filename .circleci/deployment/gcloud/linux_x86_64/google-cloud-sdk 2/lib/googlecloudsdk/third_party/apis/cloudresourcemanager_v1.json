However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints\/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects\/bar` parented by `organizations\/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: \"E3\" allowed_values: \"E4\"} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects\/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: \"E3\" value: \"E4\" inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects\/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: \"E1\"} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects\/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects\/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations\/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects\/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects\/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects\/bar`.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

NOTE: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand how the service account is being used before removing or updating its roles. For additional information about `resource` (e.g. my-project-id) structure and identification, see [Resource Names](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/apis\/design\/resource_names). The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`: + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`. + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group that is part of an organization. For example, group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com organization. + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation. + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must explicitly accept the invitation. + You can only grant ownership of a project to a member by using the GCP Console. Inviting a member will deliver an invitation email that they must accept. An invitation email is not generated if you are granting a role other than owner, or if both the member you are inviting and the project are part of your organization. + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected. + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified. Authorization requires the Google IAM permission `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` on the project"
