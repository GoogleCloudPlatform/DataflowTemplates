  clientTtl:
    description: |-
      Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) TTL, separate from
      the TTL for Cloud CDN's edge caches. Leaving this empty will use the
      same cache TTL for both Cloud CDN and the client-facing response. The
      maximum allowed value is 86400s (1 day).
    type: integer
  defaultTtl:
    description: |-
      Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for
      responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-
      age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate" and a value of
      "-1" disables caching for that status code. The value of defaultTTL
      cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be
      equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL
      will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value
      is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may
      be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    type: integer
  maxTtl:
    description: |-
      Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this
      origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value
      of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Setting a TTL of "0" means
      "always revalidate" and a value of "-1" disables caching for that
      status code. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting
      that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache
      before the defined TTL.
    type: integer
  negativeCaching:
    description: |-
      Negative caching lets you set per-status code TTLs, in order to
      apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can
      reduce the load on your origin and improve the end-user experience by
      reducing response latency. By default, Cloud CDN applies the
      following default TTLs to these status codes:   -300 (Multiple
      Choice)   -301 and 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m   -404 (Not Found)  -410
      (Gone)   -451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s -405 (Method Not
      Found)   -414 (URI Too Long)   -501 (Not Implemented): 60s These defaults
      can be overridden by a negative caching policy.
    type: boolean
  negativeCachingPolicy:
    description: |-
      Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status codes. Negative caching
      must be enabled to configure a negative caching policy. If you omit a
      policy and have negative caching enabled, Cloud CDN uses the
      default cache TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit
      negative caching policy, make sure to specify a cache TTL
      for all response codes that you want to cache. Cloud CDN doesn't
      apply any default negative caching when a policy exists.

  signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec:
    description: |-
      Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be
      considered fresh. After this time period, the response will be revalidated
      before being served. Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to
      signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all
      responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]"
      header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual
      headers served in responses will not be altered.
