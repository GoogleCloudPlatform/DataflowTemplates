    description: |-
      Applicable only to Failover for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing. If set to
      true, connections to the load balancer are dropped when all primary and
      all backup backend VMs are unhealthy. If set to false, connections are
      distributed among all primary VMs when all primary and all backup backend
      VMs are unhealthy.  The default is false.

  failoverRatio:
    description: |-
      Applicable only to Failover for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing. The value
      of the field must be in the range [0, 1]. If the value is 0, the load
      balancer performs a failover when the number of healthy primary VMs equals
      zero. For all other values, the load balancer performs a failover when the
      total number of healthy primary VMs is less than this ratio.
