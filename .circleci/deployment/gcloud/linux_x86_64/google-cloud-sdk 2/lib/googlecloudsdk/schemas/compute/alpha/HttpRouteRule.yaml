  priority:
    description: |-
      For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines
      the order in which load balancer will interpret routeRules.
      RouteRules are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest
      to highest number. The priority of a rule decreases as its
      number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule that matches
      the request is applied. You cannot configure two or more
      routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must
      be set to a number between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive.
      Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or
      remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the
      rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series
      of priority numbers to which you could add rules numbered from
      6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any
      impact on existing rules.
    type: integer
  routeAction:
    description: |-
      In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer
      performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header
      transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the
      selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely
      if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    $ref: HttpRouteAction.yaml
  service:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to
      which traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If
      routeAction is additionally specified, advanced routing
      actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
      the request to the backend. However, if service is specified,
      routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendService s.
      Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only
      one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    type: string
  urlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service
      or routeAction must not be set.
