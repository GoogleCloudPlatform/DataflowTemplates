  balancingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies the balancing mode for the backend.  When choosing a balancing
      mode, you need to consider the loadBalancingScheme, and protocol for the
      backend service, as well as the type of backend (instance group or NEG).
      - If the load balancing mode is CONNECTION, then the load is spread based
      on how many concurrent connections the backend can handle. You can use the
      CONNECTION balancing mode if the protocol for the backend service is SSL,
      TCP, or UDP.  If the loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is
      EXTERNAL (SSL Proxy and TCP Proxy load balancers), you must also specify
      exactly one of the following parameters: maxConnections (except for
      regional managed instance groups), maxConnectionsPerInstance, or
      maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  If the loadBalancingScheme for the backend
      service is INTERNAL (internal TCP/UDP load balancers), you cannot specify
      any additional parameters.   - If the load balancing mode is RATE, the
      load is spread based on the rate of HTTP requests per second (RPS). You
      can use the RATE balancing mode if the protocol for the backend service is
      HTTP or HTTPS. You must specify exactly one of the following parameters:
      maxRate (except for regional managed instance groups), maxRatePerInstance,
      or maxRatePerEndpoint.   - If the load balancing mode is UTILIZATION, the
      load is spread based on the backend utilization of instances in an
      instance group. You can use the UTILIZATION balancing mode if the
      loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is EXTERNAL,
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED and the backends are instance
      groups. There are no restrictions on the backend service protocol.
    type: string
    enum:
    - CONNECTION
    - RATE
    - UTILIZATION
  capacityScaler:
    description: |-
      A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity (based on
      UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION). Default value is 1, which means the
      group will serve up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on
      balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained,
      offering 0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].  This
      cannot be used for internal load balancing.
    type: number
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  failover:
    description: |-
      This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one
      failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
    type: boolean
  group:
    description: |-
      The fully-qualified URL of an instance group or network endpoint group
      (NEG) resource. The type of backend that a backend service supports
      depends on the backend service's loadBalancingScheme.    - When the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is EXTERNAL,
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED, the backend can be either an
      instance group or a NEG. The backends on the backend service must be
      either all instance groups or all NEGs. You cannot mix instance group and
      NEG backends on the same backend service.    - When the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is INTERNAL, the backend must
      be an instance group in the same region as the backend service. NEGs are
      not supported.    You must use the fully-qualified URL (starting with
      https://www.googleapis.com/) to specify the instance group or NEG. Partial
      URLs are not supported.
    type: string
  maxConnections:
    description: |-
      Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous connections that the
      backend can handle. Valid for network endpoint group and instance group
      backends (except for regional managed instance groups). If the backend's
      balancingMode is UTILIZATION, this is an optional parameter. If the
      backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION, and backend is attached to a
      backend service whose loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, you must specify
      either this parameter, maxConnectionsPerInstance, or
      maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  Not available if the backend's balancingMode
      is RATE. If the loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL, then maxConnections is
      not supported, even though the backend requires a balancing mode of
      CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous connections for an
      endpoint of a NEG. This is multiplied by the number of endpoints in the
      NEG to implicitly calculate a maximum number of target maximum
      simultaneous connections for the NEG. If the backend's balancingMode is
      CONNECTION, and the backend is attached to a backend service whose
      loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, you must specify either this parameter,
      maxConnections, or maxConnectionsPerInstance.  Not available if the
      backend's balancingMode is RATE. Internal TCP/UDP load balancing does not
      support setting maxConnectionsPerEndpoint even though its backends require
      a balancing mode of CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerInstance:
    description: |-
      Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous connections for a single
      VM in a backend instance group. This is multiplied by the number of
      instances in the instance group to implicitly calculate a target maximum
      number of simultaneous connections for the whole instance group. If the
      backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION, this is an optional parameter. If
      the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION, and backend is attached to a
      backend service whose loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, you must specify
      either this parameter, maxConnections, or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is RATE. Internal TCP/UDP load
      balancing does not support setting maxConnectionsPerInstance even though
      its backends require a balancing mode of CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxRate:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum number of HTTP requests per second (RPS) that the
      backend can handle. Valid for network endpoint group and instance group
      backends (except for regional managed instance groups). Must not be
      defined if the backend is a managed instance group that uses autoscaling
      based on load balancing.  If the backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION,
      this is an optional parameter. If the backend's balancingMode is RATE, you
      must specify maxRate, maxRatePerInstance, or maxRatePerEndpoint.  Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxRatePerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS) for an endpoint of
      a NEG. This is multiplied by the number of endpoints in the NEG to
      implicitly calculate a target maximum rate for the NEG. If the backend's
      balancingMode is RATE, you must specify either this parameter, maxRate
      (except for regional managed instance groups), or maxRatePerInstance.  Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION.
    type: number
  maxRatePerInstance:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS) for a single VM in
      a backend instance group. This is multiplied by the number of instances in
      the instance group to implicitly calculate a target maximum rate for the
      whole instance group.  If the backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION, this
      is an optional parameter. If the backend's balancingMode is RATE, you must
      specify either this parameter, maxRate (except for regional managed
      instance groups), or maxRatePerEndpoint.  Not available if the backend's
      balancingMode is CONNECTION.
    type: number
  maxUtilization:
    description: |-
      Defines the maximum average backend utilization of a backend VM in an
      instance group. The valid range is [0.0, 1.0]. This is an optional
      parameter if the backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION. This parameter
      can be used in conjunction with maxRate, maxRatePerInstance,
      maxConnections (except for regional managed instance groups), or
      maxConnectionsPerInstance.
