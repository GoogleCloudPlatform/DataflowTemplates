      List of authentication methods that can be used for origin authentication.
      Similar to peers, these will be evaluated in order the first valid one
      will be used to set origin identity. If none of these methods pass, the
      request will be rejected with authentication failed error (401). Leave the
      list empty if origin authentication is not required.

      Define whether peer or origin identity should be used for
      principal. Default value is USE_PEER. If peer (or origin) identity
      is not available, either because peer/origin authentication is not
      defined, or failed, principal will be left unset. In other words,
      binding rule does not affect the decision to accept or reject
      request. This field can be set to one of the following: USE_PEER:
      Principal will be set to the identity from peer authentication.
      USE_ORIGIN: Principal will be set to the identity from origin
      authentication.
