<B>OVERVIEW</B>
  This help section provides details about various precautions taken by gsutil
  to protect data security, as well as recommendations for how customers should
  safeguard security.


<B>TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY</B>
  gsutil performs all operations using transport-layer encryption (HTTPS), to
  protect against data leakage over shared network links. This is also important
  because gsutil uses "bearer tokens" for authentication (OAuth2) as well as for
  resumable upload identifiers, and such tokens must be protected from being
  eavesdropped and reused.

  gsutil also supports the older HMAC style of authentication via the XML API
  (see "gsutil help apis").  While HMAC authentication does not use bearer
  tokens (and thus is not subject to eavesdropping/replay attacks), it's still
  important to encrypt data traffic.

  Prior to gsutil release 4.0 it was possible to use HTTP instead of HTTPS by
  setting the "is_secure" configuration parameter in the [Boto] section of the
  boto configuration file to False. However, starting with gsutil version 4.0
  setting is_secure to False is disallowed.  For more details about different
  credential options, see "gsutil help creds".


<B>LOCAL FILE STORAGE SECURITY</B>
  gsutil takes a number of precautions to protect against security exploits in
  the files it stores locally:

  - When the gsutil config (or gcloud init for Cloud SDK installs) command runs
    it sets file protection mode 600 ("-rw-------") on the .boto
    configuration file it generates, so only the user (or superuser) can read
    it. This is important because these files contain security-sensitive
    information, including credentials and proxy configuration.

  - The gsutil config (or gcloud init for Cloud SDK installs) command also uses
    file protection mode 600 for the private key file stored locally when you
    create service account credentials.

  - The default level of logging output from gsutil commands does not include
    security-sensitive information, such as OAuth2 tokens and proxy
    configuration information. (See the "RECOMMENDED USER PRECAUTIONS" section
    below if you increase the level of debug output, using the gsutil -D
    option.)

  Note that protection modes are not supported on Windows, so if you
  use gsutil on Windows we recommend using an encrypted file system and strong
  account passwords.


<B>SECURITY-SENSITIVE FILES WRITTEN TEMPORARILY TO DISK BY GSUTIL</B>
  gsutil buffers data in temporary files in several situations:

  - While compressing data being uploaded via gsutil cp -z/-Z, gsutil
    buffers the data in temporary files with protection 600, which it
    deletes after the upload is complete (similarly for downloading files
    that were uploaded with gsutil cp -z/-Z or some other process that sets the
    Content-Encoding to "gzip"). However, if you kill the gsutil process
    while the upload is under way the partially written file will be left
    in place. See the "CHANGING TEMP DIRECTORIES" section in
    "gsutil help cp" for details of where the temporary files are written
    and how to change the temp directory location.

  - When performing a resumable upload gsutil stores the upload ID (which,
    as noted above, is a bearer token and thus should be safe-guarded) in a
    file under ~/.gsutil/tracker-files with protection 600, and deletes this
    file after the upload is complete. However, if the upload doesn't
    complete successfully the tracker file is left in place so the resumable
    upload can be re-attempted later. Over time it's possible to accumulate
    these tracker files from aborted upload attempts, though resumable
    upload IDs are only valid for 1 week, so the security risk only exists
    for files less than that age. If you consider the risk of leaving
    aborted upload IDs in the tracker directory too high you could modify
    your upload scripts to delete the tracker files; or you could create a
    cron job to clear the tracker directory periodically.

  - The gsutil rsync command stores temporary files (with protection 600)
    containing the names, sizes, and checksums of source and destination
    directories/buckets, which it deletes after the rsync is complete.
    However, if you kill the gsutil process while the rsync is under way the
    listing files will be left in place.

  Note that gsutil deletes temporary files using the standard OS unlink system
  call, which does not perform `data wiping
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_erasure>`_. Thus, the content of such
  temporary files can be recovered by a determined adversary.


<B>ACCESS CONTROL LISTS</B>
  Unless you specify a different ACL (e.g., via the gsutil cp -a option), by
  default objects written to a bucket use the default object ACL on that bucket.
  Unless you modify that ACL (e.g., via the gsutil defacl command), by default
  it will allow all project editors write access to the object and read/write
  access to the object's metadata and will allow all project viewers read
  access to the object.

  The Google Cloud Storage access control system includes the ability to
  specify that objects are publicly readable. Make sure you intend for any
  objects you write with this permission to be public. Once "published", data
  on the Internet can be copied to many places, so it's effectively impossible
  to regain read control over an object written with this permission.

  The Google Cloud Storage access control system includes the ability to
  specify that buckets are publicly writable. While configuring a bucket this
  way can be convenient for various purposes, we recommend against using this
  permission - it can be abused for distributing illegal content, viruses, and
  other malware, and the bucket owner is legally and financially responsible
  for the content stored in their buckets. If you need to make content
  available to customers who don't have Google accounts consider instead using
  signed URLs (see "gsutil help signurl").


<B>SOFTWARE INTEGRITY AND UPDATES</B>
  gsutil is distributed as a standalone bundle via tar and zip files stored in
  the gs://pub bucket, as a PyPi module, and as part of the bundled Cloud
  SDK release. Each of these distribution methods takes a variety of security
  precautions to protect the integrity of the software. We strongly recommend
  against getting a copy of gsutil from any other sources (such as mirror
  sites).


<B>PROXY USAGE</B>
  gsutil supports access via proxies, such as Squid and a number of commercial
  products. A full description of their capabilities is beyond the scope of this
  documentation, but proxies can be configured to support many security-related
  functions, including virus scanning, Data Leakage Prevention, control over
  which certificates/CA's are trusted, content type filtering, and many more
  capabilities. Some of these features can slow or block legitimate gsutil
  behavior. For example, virus scanning depends on decrypting file content,
  which in turn requires that the proxy terminate the gsutil connection and
  establish a new connection - and in some cases proxies will rewrite content in
  ways that result in checksum validation errors and other problems.

  For details on configuring proxies see the proxy help text in your .boto
  configuration file (generated by the gsutil config or gcloud init command).


<B>ENCRYPTION AT REST</B>
  All Google Cloud Storage data are stored encrypted. For more information see
  `Server-Side Encryption
  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption#server-side>`_.

  You can also provide your own encryption keys. For more information, see
  "gsutil help encryption".


<B>DATA PRIVACY</B>
  Google will never ask you to share your credentials, password, or other
  security-sensitive information. Beware of potential phishing scams where
  someone attempts to impersonate Google and asks for such information.


<B>MEASUREMENT DATA</B>
  The gsutil perfdiag command collects a variety of performance-related
  measurements and details about your local system and network environment, for
  use in troubleshooting performance problems. None of this information will be
  sent to Google unless you choose to send it.


<B>RECOMMENDED USER PRECAUTIONS</B>
  The first and foremost precaution is: Never share your credentials. Each user
  should have distinct credentials.

  If you run gsutil -D (to generate debugging output) it will include OAuth2
  refresh and access tokens in the output. Make sure to redact this information
  before sending this debug output to anyone during troubleshooting/tech support
  interactions.

  If you run gsutil --trace-token (to send a trace directly to Google),
  sensitive information like OAuth2 tokens and the contents of any files
  accessed during the trace may be included in the content of the trace.

  Customer-supplied encryption key information in the .boto configuration is
  security sensitive.

  The proxy configuration information in the .boto configuration is
  security-sensitive, especially if your proxy setup requires user and
  password information. Even if your proxy setup doesn't require user and
  password, the host and port number for your proxy is often considered
  security-sensitive. Protect access to your .boto configuration file.

  If you are using gsutil from a production environment (e.g., via a cron job
  running on a host in your data center), use service account credentials rather
  than individual user account credentials. These credentials were designed for
  such use and, for example, protect you from losing access when an employee
  leaves your company.
