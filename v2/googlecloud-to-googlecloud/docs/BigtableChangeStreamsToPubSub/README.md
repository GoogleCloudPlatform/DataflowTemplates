# Cloud Bigtable Change Streams To Pub/Sub Dataflow Template
NOTE: This template is currently unreleased. If you wish to use it now, you
will need to follow the steps outlined below to add it to and run it from
your own Google Cloud project. Make sure to be in the /v2 directory.

The [BigtableChangeStreamsToPubSub](src/main/java/com/google/cloud/teleport/v2/templates/bigtablechangestreamstopubsub/BigtableChangeStreamsToPubSub.java)
pipeline reads messages from Cloud Bigtable Change Streams and publish them through Pub/Sub.

Change log schema is defined as follows:
