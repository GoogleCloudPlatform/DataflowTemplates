      The list of URLs to HttpFilter resources enabled for xDS clients using
      this configuration. Only filters that handle inbound connection and stream
      events must be specified. These filters work in conjunction with a default
      set of HTTP filters that may already be configured by Traffic Director.
      Traffic Director will determine the final location of these filters within
      xDS configuration based on the name of the HTTP filter. If Traffic
      Director positions multiple filters at the same location, those filters
      will be in the same order as specified in this list.
