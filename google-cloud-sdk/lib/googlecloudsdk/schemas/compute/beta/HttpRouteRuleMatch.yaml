  fullPathMatch:
    description: |-
      For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request must
      exactly match the value specified in fullPathMatch after removing any
      query parameters and anchor that may be part of the original URL.
      fullPathMatch must be between 1 and 1024 characters. Only one of
      prefixMatch, fullPathMatch or regexMatch must be specified.
    type: string
  headerMatches:
    description: |-
      Specifies a list of header match criteria, all of which must match
      corresponding headers in the request.

  ignoreCase:
    description: |-
      Specifies that prefixMatch and fullPathMatch matches are case
      sensitive. The default value is false. ignoreCase must not be used
      with regexMatch.
    type: boolean
  metadataFilters:
    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
      configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
      requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
      match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made
      available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if
      its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
      filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
      metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
      its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the
      metadata. metadataFilters specified here will be applied after those
      specified in ForwardingRule that refers to the UrlMap this
      HttpRouteRuleMatch belongs to. metadataFilters only applies to
      Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

  prefixMatch:
    description: |-
      For satisfying the matchRule condition, the request's path must
      begin with the specified prefixMatch. prefixMatch must begin with
      a /. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters. Only one of
      prefixMatch, fullPathMatch or regexMatch must be specified.

      must match corresponding query parameters in the request.

  regexMatch:
    description: |-
      For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the
      request must satisfy the regular expression specified in
      regexMatch after removing any query parameters and anchor
      supplied with the original URL. For regular expression grammar
      please see en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript  Only
      one of prefixMatch, fullPathMatch or regexMatch must be
      specified. Note that regexMatch only applies to Loadbalancers
      that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
