  baseEjectionTime:
    description: |-
      The base time that a host is ejected for. The real ejection time is equal
      to the base ejection time multiplied by the number of times the host has
      been ejected. Defaults to 30000ms or 30s.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  consecutiveErrors:
    description: |-
      Number of errors before a host is ejected from the connection pool. When
      the backend host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies as an
      error. Defaults to 5.
    type: integer
  consecutiveGatewayFailure:
    description: |-
      The number of consecutive gateway failures (502, 503, 504 status or
      connection errors that are mapped to one of those status codes) before a
      consecutive gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 3.
    type: integer
  enforcingConsecutiveErrors:
    description: |-
      The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
      status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to
      disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 0.
    type: integer
  enforcingConsecutiveGatewayFailure:
    description: |-
      The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
      status is detected through consecutive gateway failures. This setting can
      be used to disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
    type: integer
  enforcingSuccessRate:
    description: |-
      The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
      status is detected through success rate statistics. This setting can be
      used to disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
    type: integer
  interval:
    description: |-
      Time interval between ejection analysis sweeps. This can result in both
      new ejections as well as hosts being returned to service. Defaults to 1
      second.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  maxEjectionPercent:
    description: |-
      Maximum percentage of hosts in the load balancing pool for the backend
      service that can be ejected. Defaults to 50%.
    type: integer
  successRateMinimumHosts:
    description: |-
      The number of hosts in a cluster that must have enough request volume to
      detect success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this
      setting, outlier detection via success rate statistics is not performed
      for any host in the cluster. Defaults to 5.
    type: integer
  successRateRequestVolume:
    description: |-
      The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one
      interval (as defined by the interval duration above) to include this host
      in success rate based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this
      setting, outlier detection via success rate statistics is not performed
      for that host. Defaults to 100.
    type: integer
  successRateStdevFactor:
    description: |-
      This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate
      outlier ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the
      mean success rate, and the product of this factor and the standard
      deviation of the mean success rate: mean - (stdev *
      success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided by a thousand to get a
      double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the runtime value should be
      1900. Defaults to 1900.
    type: integer
