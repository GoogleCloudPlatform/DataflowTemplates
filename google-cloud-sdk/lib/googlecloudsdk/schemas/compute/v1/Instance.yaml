      instance to forward routes. For more information, see Enabling IP
      Forwarding.

      every request to modify or update the instance. You must always
      provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update the
      instance.  To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the
      instance.

  labelFingerprint:
    description: |-
      A fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the

      is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every
      request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-
      to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels.  To
      see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.
    type: string
  labels:
    description: |-
      Labels to apply to this instance. These can be later modified by
      the setLabels method.
    $ref: LabelsValue.yaml
  machineType:
    description: |-
      Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for this
      instance, in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type.
      This is provided by the client when the instance is created. For
      example, the following is a valid partial url to a predefined
      machine type: zones/us- central1-f/machineTypes/n1-standard-1   To
      create a custom machine type, provide a URL to a machine type in
      the following format, where CPUS is 1 or an even number up to 32
      (2, 4, 6, ... 24, etc), and MEMORY is the total memory for this
      instance. Memory must be a multiple of 256 MB and must be supplied
      in MB (e.g. 5 GB of memory is 5120 MB):
      zones/zone/machineTypes/custom-CPUS-MEMORY   For example:
      zones/us- central1-f/machineTypes/custom-4-5120   For a full list
      of restrictions, read the Specifications for custom machine types.
    type: string
  metadata:
    description: |-

      The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially
      creating the resource. The resource name must be 1-63 characters

      characters long and match the regular expression
      `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must
      be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a

      within the list must comply with RFC1035. Multiple tags
      can be specified via the 'tags.items' field.
