      Determines if server allows plaintext connections. If set to true, server
      allows plain text connections. By default, it is set to false. This
      setting is not exclusive of other encryption modes. For example, if
      allow_open and mtls_policy are set, server allows both plain text and mTLS
      connections. See documentation of other encryption modes to confirm
      compatibility.

  mtlsPolicy:
    description: |-
      Defines a mechanism to provision peer validation certificates for peer to
      peer authentication (Mutual TLS - mTLS). If not specified, client
      certificate will not be requested. The connection is treated as TLS and
      not mTLS. If allow_open and mtls_policy are set, server allows both plain
      text and mTLS connections.

  serverCertificate:
    description: |-
      Defines a mechanism to provision server identity (public and private
      keys). Cannot be combined with allow_open as a permissive mode that allows
      both plain text and TLS is not supported.
