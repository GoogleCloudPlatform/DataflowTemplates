  r"""A `Constraint` describes a way in which a resource's configuration can
  be restricted. For example, it controls which cloud services can be
  activated across an organization, or whether a Compute Engine instance can
  have serial port connections established. `Constraints` can be configured by
  the organization's policy adminstrator to fit the needs of the organzation
  by setting Policies for `Constraints` at different locations in the
  organization's resource hierarchy. Policies are inherited down the resource
  hierarchy from higher levels, but can also be overridden. For details about
  the inheritance rules please read about Policies. `Constraints` have a
  default behavior determined by the `constraint_default` field, which is the
  enforcement behavior that is used in the absence of a `Policy` being defined
  or inherited for the resource in question.

    ConstraintDefaultValueValuesEnum: The evaluation behavior of this
