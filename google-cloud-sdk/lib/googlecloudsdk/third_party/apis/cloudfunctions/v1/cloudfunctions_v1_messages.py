  specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
  service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the
  exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with

      controlling what traffic can reach it.
    StatusValueValuesEnum: Output only. Status of the function deployment.
    VpcConnectorEgressSettingsValueValuesEnum: The egress settings for the
      connector, controlling what traffic is diverted through it.

  Messages:
    BuildEnvironmentVariablesValue: Build environment variables that shall be
      available during build time.
    EnvironmentVariablesValue: Environment variables that shall be available
      during function execution.
    LabelsValue: Labels associated with this Cloud Function.

  Fields:
    availableMemoryMb: The amount of memory in MB available for a function.
      Defaults to 256MB.
    buildEnvironmentVariables: Build environment variables that shall be
      available during build time.
    buildId: Output only. The Cloud Build ID of the latest successful
      deployment of the function.
    buildWorkerPool: Name of the Cloud Build Custom Worker Pool that should be
      used to build the function. The format of this field is
      `projects/{project}/locations/{region}/workerPools/{workerPool}` where
      {project} and {region} are the project id and region respectively where
      the worker pool is defined and {workerPool} is the short name of the
      worker pool. If the project id is not the same as the function, then the
      Cloud Functions Service Agent (service-@gcf-admin-
      robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must be granted the role Cloud Build
      Custom Workers Builder (roles/cloudbuild.customworkers.builder) in the
      project.
    description: User-provided description of a function.
    entryPoint: The name of the function (as defined in source code) that will
      be executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix, if not specified. For
      backward compatibility, if function with given name is not found, then
      the system will try to use function named "function". For Node.js this
      is name of a function exported by the module specified in
      `source_location`.
    environmentVariables: Environment variables that shall be available during
      function execution.
    eventTrigger: A source that fires events in response to a condition in
      another service.
    httpsTrigger: An HTTPS endpoint type of source that can be triggered via
      URL.
    ingressSettings: The ingress settings for the function, controlling what
      traffic can reach it.
    labels: Labels associated with this Cloud Function.
    maxInstances: The limit on the maximum number of function instances that
      may coexist at a given time. In some cases, such as rapid traffic
      surges, Cloud Functions may, for a short period of time, create more
      instances than the specified max instances limit. If your function
      cannot tolerate this temporary behavior, you may want to factor in a
      safety margin and set a lower max instances value than your function can
      tolerate. See the [Max
      Instances](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/max-instances) Guide
      for more details.
    name: A user-defined name of the function. Function names must be unique
      globally and match pattern `projects/*/locations/*/functions/*`
    network: The VPC Network that this cloud function can connect to. It can
      be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network
      resource. If the short network name is used, the network must belong to
      the same project. Otherwise, it must belong to a project within the same
      organization. The format of this field is either
      `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}` or `{network}`, where
      {project} is a project id where the network is defined, and {network} is
      the short name of the network. This field is mutually exclusive with
      `vpc_connector` and will be replaced by it. See [the VPC
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc) for more
      information on connecting Cloud projects.
    runtime: The runtime in which to run the function. Required when deploying
      a new function, optional when updating an existing function. For a
      complete list of possible choices, see the [`gcloud` command
      reference](/sdk/gcloud/reference/functions/deploy#--runtime).
    serviceAccountEmail: The email of the function's service account. If
      empty, defaults to `{project_id}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
    sourceArchiveUrl: The Google Cloud Storage URL, starting with gs://,
      pointing to the zip archive which contains the function.
    sourceRepository: **Beta Feature** The source repository where a function
      is hosted.
    sourceUploadUrl: The Google Cloud Storage signed URL used for source
      uploading, generated by google.cloud.functions.v1.GenerateUploadUrl
    status: Output only. Status of the function deployment.
    timeout: The function execution timeout. Execution is considered failed
      and can be terminated if the function is not completed at the end of the
      timeout period. Defaults to 60 seconds.
    updateTime: Output only. The last update timestamp of a Cloud Function.
    versionId: Output only. The version identifier of the Cloud Function. Each
      deployment attempt results in a new version of a function being created.
    vpcConnector: The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can
      connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name
      of the network connector resource. The format of this field is
      `projects/*/locations/*/connectors/*` This field is mutually exclusive
      with `network` field and will eventually replace it. See [the VPC

      `providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change` and
      `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`. Event types match
      pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`. The pattern contains: 1.
      namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and `google.firebase.analytics`.
      2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For
      example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`. 3.
      action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for a
      Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'. These parts are lower case.
    failurePolicy: Specifies policy for failed executions.
    resource: Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for
      example, `projects/_/buckets/myBucket`. Not all syntactically correct
      values are accepted by all services. For example: 1. The authorization
      model must support it. Google Cloud Functions only allows EventTriggers
      to be deployed that observe resources in the same project as the
      `CloudFunction`. 2. The resource type must match the pattern expected
      for an `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
      `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
      that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics. Additionally, some services
      may support short names when creating an `EventTrigger`. These will
      always be returned in the normalized "long" format. See each *service's*
      documentation for supported formats.
    service: The hostname of the service that should be observed. If no string
      is provided, the default service implementing the API will be used. For
      example, `storage.googleapis.com` is the default for all event types in
      the `google.storage` namespace.

  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
  three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can
  find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API
  Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

    DetailsValueListEntry: A DetailsValueListEntry object.

  Fields:
    code: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    details: A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a
      common set of message types for APIs to use.
    message: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
      user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
      google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
