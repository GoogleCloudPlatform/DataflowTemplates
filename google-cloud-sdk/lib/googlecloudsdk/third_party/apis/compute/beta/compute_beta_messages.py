      or STANDARD. Global forwarding rules can only be Premium Tier. Regional
      forwarding rules can be either Premium or Standard Tier. Standard Tier
      addresses applied to regional forwarding rules can be used with any
      external load balancer. Regional forwarding rules in Premium Tier can
      only be used with a network load balancer.  If this field is not
      specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
    PurposeValueValuesEnum: The purpose of this resource, which can be one of
      the following values:   - `GCE_ENDPOINT` for addresses that are used by
      VM instances, alias IP ranges, internal load balancers, and similar
      resources.  - `DNS_RESOLVER` for a DNS resolver address in a subnetwork
      - `VPC_PEERING` for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.
      - `NAT_AUTO` for addresses that are external IP addresses automatically
      reserved for Cloud NAT.  - `IPSEC_INTERCONNECT` for addresses created
      from a private IP range that are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an
      IPsec encrypted Interconnect configuration. These addresses are regional
      resources.
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the address, which can
      be one of RESERVING, RESERVED, or IN_USE. An address that is RESERVING
      is currently in the process of being reserved. A RESERVED address is
      currently reserved and available to use. An IN_USE address is currently
      being used by another resource and is not available.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    address: The static IP address represented by this resource.
    addressType: The type of address to reserve, either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL.
      If unspecified, defaults to EXTERNAL.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this field
      when you create the resource.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ipVersion: The IP version that will be used by this address. Valid options
      are IPV4 or IPV6. This can only be specified for a global address.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#address for
      addresses.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      Address, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet.  To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve an Address.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the
      last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit. The last
      character must be a lowercase letter or digit.
    network: The URL of the network in which to reserve the address. This
      field can only be used with INTERNAL type with the VPC_PEERING purpose.
    networkTier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this
      address and can only take the following values: PREMIUM or STANDARD.
      Global forwarding rules can only be Premium Tier. Regional forwarding
      rules can be either Premium or Standard Tier. Standard Tier addresses
      applied to regional forwarding rules can be used with any external load
      balancer. Regional forwarding rules in Premium Tier can only be used
      with a network load balancer.  If this field is not specified, it is
      assumed to be PREMIUM.
    prefixLength: The prefix length if the resource reprensents an IP range.
    purpose: The purpose of this resource, which can be one of the following
      values:   - `GCE_ENDPOINT` for addresses that are used by VM instances,
      alias IP ranges, internal load balancers, and similar resources.  -
      `DNS_RESOLVER` for a DNS resolver address in a subnetwork  -
      `VPC_PEERING` for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.  -

      reserved for Cloud NAT.  - `IPSEC_INTERCONNECT` for addresses created
      from a private IP range that are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an
      IPsec encrypted Interconnect configuration. These addresses are regional
      resources.
    region: [Output Only] The URL of the region where the regional address
      resides. This field is not applicable to global addresses. You must
      specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the address, which can be one of
      RESERVING, RESERVED, or IN_USE. An address that is RESERVING is
      currently in the process of being reserved. A RESERVED address is
      currently reserved and available to use. An IN_USE address is currently
      being used by another resource and is not available.
    subnetwork: The URL of the subnetwork in which to reserve the address. If
      an IP address is specified, it must be within the subnetwork's IP range.
      This field can only be used with INTERNAL type with a GCE_ENDPOINT or
      DNS_RESOLVER purpose.

    diskEncryptionKey: Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied

      new disk using an encryption key that you provide. If you are attaching
      an existing disk that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk
      using the customer-supplied encryption key.  If you encrypt a disk using

      provide the key when you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or
      when you attach the disk to a virtual machine instance.  If you do not
      provide an encryption key, then the disk will be encrypted using an
      automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use

  Enums:
    UtilizationTargetTypeValueValuesEnum: Defines how target utilization value

      DELTA_PER_SECOND, or DELTA_PER_MINUTE.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring filter
      string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is used to select a
      specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine
      whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data.  For the
      filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply:
      - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.  - You can
      only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any functions
      for each selector.  - You can specify the metric in both the filter
      string and in the metric field. However, if specified in both places,
      the metric must be identical.  - The monitored resource type determines
      what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a
      gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate
      TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot
      filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the
      autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the
      entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be
      performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
      This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.  If
      not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.    You should provide
      a filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the
      autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using
      gce_instance resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon
      the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective values to
      obtain its scaling value.
    metric: The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric. The
      metric cannot have negative values.  The metric must have a value type
      of INT64 or DOUBLE.
    singleInstanceAssignment: If scaling is based on a per-group metric value
      that represents the total amount of work to be done or resource usage,
      set this value to an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled
      group. Autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
      value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due to
      group resizing.  A good metric to use with the target is for example
      pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a custom
      metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your instances.
      A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median latency,
      since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a single instance,
      it could be better used with utilization_target instead.
    utilizationTarget: The target value of the metric that autoscaler should
      maintain. This must be a positive value. A utilization metric scales
      number of virtual machines handling requests to increase or decrease
      proportionally to the metric.  For example, a good metric to use as a
      utilization_target is https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/net
      work/received_bytes_count. The autoscaler will work to keep this value
      constant for each of the instances.

      loadBalancingScheme, and protocol for the backend service, as well as
      the type of backend (instance group or NEG).    - If the load balancing
      mode is CONNECTION, then the load is spread based on how many concurrent
      connections the backend can handle. You can use the CONNECTION balancing
      mode if the protocol for the backend service is SSL, TCP, or UDP.  If
      the loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is EXTERNAL (SSL Proxy
      and TCP Proxy load balancers), you must also specify exactly one of the

      instance groups), maxConnectionsPerInstance, or
      maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  If the loadBalancingScheme for the backend
      service is INTERNAL (internal TCP/UDP load balancers), you cannot
      specify any additional parameters.   - If the load balancing mode is
      RATE, the load is spread based on the rate of HTTP requests per second

      backend service is HTTP or HTTPS. You must specify exactly one of the
      following parameters: maxRate (except for regional managed instance
      groups), maxRatePerInstance, or maxRatePerEndpoint.   - If the load
      balancing mode is UTILIZATION, the load is spread based on the backend
      utilization of instances in an instance group. You can use the
      UTILIZATION balancing mode if the loadBalancingScheme of the backend
      service is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED and the
      backends are instance groups. There are no restrictions on the backend
      service protocol.

      following parameters: maxConnections (except for regional managed
      instance groups), maxConnectionsPerInstance, or
      maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  If the loadBalancingScheme for the backend
      service is INTERNAL (internal TCP/UDP load balancers), you cannot
      specify any additional parameters.   - If the load balancing mode is
      RATE, the load is spread based on the rate of HTTP requests per second
      (RPS). You can use the RATE balancing mode if the protocol for the
      backend service is HTTP or HTTPS. You must specify exactly one of the

      utilization of instances in an instance group. You can use the
      UTILIZATION balancing mode if the loadBalancingScheme of the backend
      service is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED and the
      backends are instance groups. There are no restrictions on the backend
      service protocol.
    capacityScaler: A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing
      capacity (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION). Default value is 1,
      which means the group will serve up to 100% of its configured capacity
      (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is
      completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity. Valid range
      is 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting larger than 0 and
      smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0 when there is only
      one backend attached to the backend service.  This cannot be used for
      internal load balancing.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    failover: This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
      than one failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
    group: The fully-qualified URL of an instance group or network endpoint
      group (NEG) resource. The type of backend that a backend service
      supports depends on the backend service's loadBalancingScheme.    - When
      the loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is EXTERNAL,
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED, the backend can be either an
      instance group or a NEG. The backends on the backend service must be
      either all instance groups or all NEGs. You cannot mix instance group
      and NEG backends on the same backend service.    - When the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is INTERNAL, the backend
      must be an instance group in the same region as the backend service.
      NEGs are not supported.    You must use the fully-qualified URL
      (starting with https://www.googleapis.com/) to specify the instance
      group or NEG. Partial URLs are not supported.
    maxConnections: Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous
      connections that the backend can handle. Valid for network endpoint
      group and instance group backends (except for regional managed instance
      groups). If the backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION, this is an
      optional parameter. If the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION, and
      backend is attached to a backend service whose loadBalancingScheme is
      EXTERNAL, you must specify either this parameter,
      maxConnectionsPerInstance, or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  Not available
      if the backend's balancingMode is RATE. If the loadBalancingScheme is
      INTERNAL, then maxConnections is not supported, even though the backend
      requires a balancing mode of CONNECTION.
    maxConnectionsPerEndpoint: Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous
      connections for an endpoint of a NEG. This is multiplied by the number
      of endpoints in the NEG to implicitly calculate a maximum number of
      target maximum simultaneous connections for the NEG. If the backend's
      balancingMode is CONNECTION, and the backend is attached to a backend
      service whose loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, you must specify either
      this parameter, maxConnections, or maxConnectionsPerInstance.  Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is RATE. Internal TCP/UDP load
      balancing does not support setting maxConnectionsPerEndpoint even though
      its backends require a balancing mode of CONNECTION.
    maxConnectionsPerInstance: Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous
      connections for a single VM in a backend instance group. This is
      multiplied by the number of instances in the instance group to
      implicitly calculate a target maximum number of simultaneous connections
      for the whole instance group. If the backend's balancingMode is
      UTILIZATION, this is an optional parameter. If the backend's
      balancingMode is CONNECTION, and backend is attached to a backend
      service whose loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, you must specify either
      this parameter, maxConnections, or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is RATE. Internal TCP/UDP load
      balancing does not support setting maxConnectionsPerInstance even though
      its backends require a balancing mode of CONNECTION.
    maxRate: Defines a maximum number of HTTP requests per second (RPS) that
      the backend can handle. Valid for network endpoint group and instance
      group backends (except for regional managed instance groups). Must not
      be defined if the backend is a managed instance group that uses
      autoscaling based on load balancing.  If the backend's balancingMode is
      UTILIZATION, this is an optional parameter. If the backend's
      balancingMode is RATE, you must specify maxRate, maxRatePerInstance, or
      maxRatePerEndpoint.  Not available if the backend's balancingMode is
      CONNECTION.
    maxRatePerEndpoint: Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS)
      for an endpoint of a NEG. This is multiplied by the number of endpoints
      in the NEG to implicitly calculate a target maximum rate for the NEG.
      If the backend's balancingMode is RATE, you must specify either this
      parameter, maxRate (except for regional managed instance groups), or
      maxRatePerInstance.  Not available if the backend's balancingMode is
      CONNECTION.
    maxRatePerInstance: Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS)
      for a single VM in a backend instance group. This is multiplied by the
      number of instances in the instance group to implicitly calculate a
      target maximum rate for the whole instance group.  If the backend's
      balancingMode is UTILIZATION, this is an optional parameter. If the
      backend's balancingMode is RATE, you must specify either this parameter,
      maxRate (except for regional managed instance groups), or
      maxRatePerEndpoint.  Not available if the backend's balancingMode is
      CONNECTION.
    maxUtilization: Defines the maximum average backend utilization of a
      backend VM in an instance group. The valid range is [0.0, 1.0]. This is
      an optional parameter if the backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION.
      This parameter can be used in conjunction with maxRate,
      maxRatePerInstance, maxConnections (except for regional managed instance
      groups), or maxConnectionsPerInstance.

      without these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will
      require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially
      impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
      "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this
      may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable)
      content.  CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including
      common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets
      (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
      uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be
      cached.

  Fields:
    bypassCacheOnRequestHeaders: Bypass the cache when the specified request
      headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Up to 5
      headers can be specified. The cache is bypassed for all
      cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.
    cacheMode: Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
      backend. The possible values are:  USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the
      origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without
      these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will require a
      full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting
      performance and increasing load on the origin server.  FORCE_CACHE_ALL
      Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or "no-cache"
      directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result
      in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content.
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common
      image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and
      CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as
      dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.
    clientTtl: Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) TTL, separate
      from the TTL for Cloud CDN's edge caches. Leaving this empty will use
      the same cache TTL for both Cloud CDN and the client-facing response.
      The maximum allowed value is 86400s (1 day).
    defaultTtl: Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
      origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or
      s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The value of
      defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can
      be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL
      will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value
      is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may
      be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    maxTtl: Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by
      this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of
      an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not
      be modified. Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed
      objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    negativeCaching: Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set,
      in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.
      This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience
      by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
      responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control,
      Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the
      specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default,
      Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
      HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404
      (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP
      405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not
      Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in
      negative_caching_policy.
    negativeCachingPolicy: Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status
      code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
      negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs. Note
      that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should
      take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to
      cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
      policy exists.
    serveWhileStale: Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when
      revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered
      when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default "max-stale"
      duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale
      directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not
      be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
      allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or
      s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1
      week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
    signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec: Maximum number of seconds the response to a
      signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the
      response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr
      (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
      internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
      "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
      existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
      will not be altered.

class BackendService(_messages.Message):
  r"""Represents a Backend Service resource.  A backend service defines how
  Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic. The backend service
  configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect
  to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and
  timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load
  balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for
  easy configuration if you need to get started quickly.  Backend services in
  Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped.  *
  [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/backendServices) * [Reg
  ional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionBackendServices)
  For more information, see Backend Services.  (== resource_for
  {$api_version}.backendService ==)

  Enums:
    LoadBalancingSchemeValueValuesEnum: Specifies the load balancer type.
      Choose EXTERNAL for load balancers that receive traffic from external
      clients. Choose INTERNAL for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing. Choose
      INTERNAL_MANAGED for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. Choose
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED for Traffic Director. A backend service created
      for one type of load balancing cannot be used with another. For more
      information, refer to Choosing a load balancer.
    LocalityLbPolicyValueValuesEnum: The load balancing algorithm used within
      the scope of the locality. The possible values are:   - ROUND_ROBIN:
      This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend is selected in
      round robin order. This is the default.  - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1)
      algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host
      which has fewer active requests.  - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load
      balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has
      the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts
      only affects 1/N of the requests.  - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a
      random healthy host.  - ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected
      based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to
      the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection
      before the connection was redirected to the load balancer.  - MAGLEV:
      used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is
      not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and
      host selection times. For more information about Maglev, see
      https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824   This field is applicable to
      either:   - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to
      HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to
      INTERNAL_MANAGED.  - A global backend service with the
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.    If
      sessionAffinity is not NONE, and this field is not set to MAGLEV or
      RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.  Only the
      default ROUND_ROBIN policy is supported when the backend service is
      referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    ProtocolValueValuesEnum: The protocol this BackendService uses to
      communicate with backends.  Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP,
      SSL, UDP or GRPC. depending on the chosen load balancer or Traffic
      Director configuration. Refer to the documentation for the load balancer
      or for Traffic Director for more information.  Must be set to GRPC when
      the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target
      gRPC proxy.
    SessionAffinityValueValuesEnum: Type of session affinity to use. The
      default is NONE. Session affinity is not applicable if the --protocol is
      UDP.  When the loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, possible values are
      NONE, CLIENT_IP, or GENERATED_COOKIE. You can use GENERATED_COOKIE if
      the protocol is HTTP or HTTPS.  When the loadBalancingScheme is
      INTERNAL, possible values are NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PROTO, or
      CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO.  When the loadBalancingScheme is
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED, possible values are NONE,
      CLIENT_IP, GENERATED_COOKIE, HEADER_FIELD, or HTTP_COOKIE.  Not
      supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is
      bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.

  Fields:
    affinityCookieTtlSec: Lifetime of cookies in seconds. Only applicable if
      the loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or
      INTERNAL_MANAGED, the protocol is HTTP or HTTPS, and the sessionAffinity
      is GENERATED_COOKIE, or HTTP_COOKIE.  If set to 0, the cookie is non-
      persistent and lasts only until the end of the browser session (or
      equivalent). The maximum allowed value is one day (86,400).  Not
      supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is
      bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    backends: The list of backends that serve this BackendService.
    cdnPolicy: Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendService.
    circuitBreakers: Settings controlling the volume of connections to a

      field is applicable to either:   - A regional backend service with the
      service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme
      set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.  - A global backend service with the
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.    Not supported
      when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to
      target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    connectionDraining: A ConnectionDraining attribute.
    connectionTrackingPolicy: A BackendServiceConnectionTrackingPolicy
      attribute.
    consistentHash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to
      provide soft session affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other
      properties. This load balancing policy is applicable only for HTTP
      connections. The affinity to a particular destination host will be lost
      when one or more hosts are added/removed from the destination service.
      This field specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This
      field is only applicable when localityLbPolicy is set to MAGLEV or
      RING_HASH.  This field is applicable to either:   - A regional backend
      service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and

    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a BackendService. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to update the BackendService,
      otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.  To see
      the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a
      BackendService.
    healthChecks: The list of URLs to the healthChecks, httpHealthChecks
      (legacy), or httpsHealthChecks (legacy) resource for health checking
      this backend service. Not all backend services support legacy health
      checks. See  Load balancer guide. Currently, at most one health check
      can be specified for each backend service. Backend services with
      instance group or zonal NEG backends must have a health check. Backend
      services with internet or serverless NEG backends must not have a health
      check.
    iap: The configurations for Identity-Aware Proxy on this resource.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.

      backend services.
    loadBalancingScheme: Specifies the load balancer type. Choose EXTERNAL for
      load balancers that receive traffic from external clients. Choose
      INTERNAL for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing. Choose INTERNAL_MANAGED
      for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. Choose INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED for
      Traffic Director. A backend service created for one type of load
      balancing cannot be used with another. For more information, refer to

    localityLbPolicy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of
      the locality. The possible values are:   - ROUND_ROBIN: This is a simple
      policy in which each healthy backend is selected in round robin order.
      This is the default.  - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects
      two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active

      ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client
      connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as
      the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection
      was redirected to the load balancer.  - MAGLEV: used as a drop in
      replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as
      ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection

      INTERNAL_MANAGED.  - A global backend service with the
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.    If
      sessionAffinity is not NONE, and this field is not set to MAGLEV or
      RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.  Only the
      default ROUND_ROBIN policy is supported when the backend service is
      referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    logConfig: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer
      traffic served by this backend service. If logging is enabled, logs will
      be exported to Stackdriver.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first

      or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.  - A global
      backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.    Not supported when the backend service is
      referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    port: Deprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the
      backend. The default value is 80.  This cannot be used if the
      loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL (Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing).

      for communication to the backend VMs in that group. Required when the
      loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED, or
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and the backends are instance groups. The named
      port must be defined on each backend instance group. This parameter has
      no meaning if the backends are NEGs.    Must be omitted when the
      loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL (Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing).
    protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with
      backends.  Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, SSL, UDP or

      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sessionAffinity: Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE.
      Session affinity is not applicable if the --protocol is UDP.  When the
      loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, possible values are NONE, CLIENT_IP, or
      GENERATED_COOKIE. You can use GENERATED_COOKIE if the protocol is HTTP
      or HTTPS.  When the loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL, possible values are
      NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PROTO, or CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO.  When the
      loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED,

      the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses
      without these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will
      require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially
      impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
      "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this
      may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable)
      content.  CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including
      common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets
      (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
      uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be
      cached.

  Fields:
    bypassCacheOnRequestHeaders: Bypass the cache when the specified request
      headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Up to 5
      headers can be specified. The cache is bypassed for all
      cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.
    cacheKeyPolicy: The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.
    cacheMode: Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
      backend. The possible values are:  USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the
      origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without
      these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will require a
      full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting
      performance and increasing load on the origin server.  FORCE_CACHE_ALL
      Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or "no-cache"
      directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result
      in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content.
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common
      image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and
      CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as
      dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.
    clientTtl: Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) TTL, separate
      from the TTL for Cloud CDN's edge caches. Leaving this empty will use
      the same cache TTL for both Cloud CDN and the client-facing response.
      The maximum allowed value is 86400s (1 day).
    defaultTtl: Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
      origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or
      s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The value of
      defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can
      be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL
      will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value
      is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may
      be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    maxTtl: Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by
      this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of
      an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not
      be modified. Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed
      objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    negativeCaching: Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set,
      in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.
      This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience
      by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
      responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control,
      Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the
      specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default,
      Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
      HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404
      (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP
      405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not
      Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in
      negative_caching_policy.
    negativeCachingPolicy: Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status
      code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
      negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs. Note
      that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should
      take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to
      cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
      policy exists.
    serveWhileStale: Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when
      revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered
      when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default "max-stale"
      duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale
      directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not
      be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
      allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or
      s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1
      week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
    signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec: Maximum number of seconds the response to a
      signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the
      response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr
      (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
      internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
      "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
      existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
      will not be altered.

  Fields:

      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on

      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page

class ComputeDisksListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeDisksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND

      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =

      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    instanceGroupManager: The name of the managed instance group. It should

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used

      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =

      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND

      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```

      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be

      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable

    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

class ComputePacketMirroringsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputePacketMirroringsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides

  Fields:

      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are

      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

    project: Project ID for this request.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    instanceGroupManager: The name of the managed instance group.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the
      logic is the same as today.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    instanceGroup: Name of the regional instance group for which we want to
      list the instances.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page

    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and

      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by

      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable

      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new

      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable

    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can

      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the

    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must

      cannot be a dash.
    options: Internal use only.
    physicalBlockSizeBytes: Physical block size of the persistent disk, in
      bytes. If not present in a request, a default value is used. The
      currently supported size is 4096, other sizes may be added in the
      future. If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will
      list the supported values for the caller's project.

      zones/zone/disks/disk
    sourceDiskId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the disk used to create this
      disk. This value identifies the exact disk that was used to create this
      persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a
      disk that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the
      source disk ID would identify the exact version of the disk that was
      used.
    sourceImage: The source image used to create this disk. If the source
      image is deleted, this field will not be set.  To create a disk with one
      of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family
      name. For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
      Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD
      To create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image
      name in the following format: global/images/my-custom-image   You can
      also specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the
      latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with
      family/family-name: global/images/family/my-image-family
    sourceImageEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source image. Required if the source image is protected by a customer-
      supplied encryption key.
    sourceImageId: [Output Only] The ID value of the image used to create this
      disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to create this
      persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an
      image that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the
      source image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was
      used.
    sourceSnapshot: The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can
      provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the
      following are valid values:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/pr
      ojects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot  -
      projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot  - global/snapshots/snapshot
    sourceSnapshotEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source snapshot. Required if the source snapshot is protected by a
      customer-supplied encryption key.
    sourceSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to
      create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used
      to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the
      persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and recreated
      under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact
      version of the snapshot that was used.
    sourceStorageObject: The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk
      image is stored. This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name
      ends in .tar.gz or virtual machine disk whose name ends in vmdk. Valid
      URIs may start with gs:// or https://storage.googleapis.com/.
    status: [Output Only] The status of disk creation. CREATING: Disk is
      provisioning. RESTORING: Source data is being copied into the disk.
      FAILED: Disk creation failed. READY: Disk is ready for use. DELETING:
      Disk is deleting.
    storageType: [Deprecated] Storage type of the persistent disk.
    type: URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to
      create the disk. Provide this when creating the disk. For example:
      projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard  or pd-ssd
    users: [Output Only] Links to the users of the disk (attached instances)
      in form: projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance
    zone: [Output Only] URL of the zone where the disk resides. You must

    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewall for
      firewall rules.
    logConfig: This field denotes the logging options for a particular
      firewall rule. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Cloud
      Logging.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?. The first character must
      be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the last
      character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit. The last
      character must be a lowercase letter or digit.
    network: URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not
      specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used:
      global/networks/default If you choose to specify this field, you can
      specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following
      are all valid URLs:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/m
      yproject/global/networks/my-network  -
      projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network  - global/networks/default
    priority: Priority for this rule. This is an integer between `0` and
      `65535`, both inclusive. The default value is `1000`. Relative
      priorities determine which rule takes effect if multiple rules apply.
      Lower values indicate higher priority. For example, a rule with priority
      `0` has higher precedence than a rule with priority `1`. DENY rules take
      precedence over ALLOW rules if they have equal priority. Note that VPC
      networks have implied rules with a priority of `65535`. To avoid
      conflicts with the implied rules, use a priority number less than
      `65535`.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sourceRanges: If source ranges are specified, the firewall rule applies
      only to traffic that has a source IP address in these ranges. These
      ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
      sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set, the rule applies to
      traffic that has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP
      from a resource with a matching tag listed in the sourceTags field. The
      connection does not need to match both fields for the rule to apply.
      Only IPv4 is supported.
    sourceServiceAccounts: If source service accounts are specified, the
      firewall rules apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a
      service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to
      control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service
      accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address.
      sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If
      both are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source IP
      address within the sourceRanges OR a source IP that belongs to an
      instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The
      connection does not need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.
      sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or
      targetTags.
    sourceTags: If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only
      to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of
      VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source
      tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
      address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same
      virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP
      addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
      both fields are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source
      IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP from a resource with a
      matching tag listed in the sourceTags field. The connection does not
      need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.
    targetServiceAccounts: A list of service accounts indicating sets of
      instances located in the network that may make network connections as
      specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same
      time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.
    targetTags: A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule
      applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies
      only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.

      Must be set to `0.0.0.0` when the target is targetGrpcProxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.  For Private Service Connect
      forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, IP address must be
      provided.
    IPProtocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol
      forwarding, valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP.  For
      Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL,
      and one of TCP or UDP are valid. For Traffic Director, the load
      balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, and only TCPis valid. For
      Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing, the load balancing scheme is
      INTERNAL_MANAGED, and only TCP is valid. For HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, and TCP
      Proxy Load Balancing, the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL and only TCP
      is valid. For Network TCP/UDP Load Balancing, the load balancing scheme
      is EXTERNAL, and one of TCP or UDP is valid.
    allPorts: This field is used along with the backend_service field for
      internal load balancing or with the target field for internal
      TargetInstance. This field cannot be used with port or portRange fields.
      When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL and protocol is TCP/UDP,
      specify this field to allow packets addressed to any ports will be
      forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule.
    allowGlobalAccess: This field is used along with the backend_service field
      for internal load balancing or with the target field for internal
      TargetInstance. If the field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from
      all regions. Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same
      region as the internal load balancer.
    backendService: This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For
      internal load balancing, this field identifies the BackendService
      resource to receive the matched traffic.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a ForwardingRule. Include the fingerprint
      in patch request to ensure that you do not overwrite changes that were
      applied from another concurrent request.  To see the latest fingerprint,
      make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ipVersion: The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid
      options are IPV4 or IPV6. This can only be specified for an external
      global forwarding rule.
    isMirroringCollector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be
      used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
      instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored
      even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This can only be set to
      true for load balancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule
      for Forwarding Rule resources.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      resource, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet.  To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a ForwardingRule.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    loadBalancingScheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type.    - EXTERNAL is
      used for:   - Classic Cloud VPN gateways  - Protocol forwarding to VMs
      from an external IP address  - The following load balancers: HTTP(S),
      SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP     - INTERNAL is used for:
      - Protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address  - Internal
      TCP/UDP load balancers    - INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for:   - Internal
      HTTP(S) load balancers    - INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED is used for:   -
      Traffic Director      For more information about forwarding rules, refer
      to Forwarding rule concepts.
    metadataFilters: Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict
      routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In
      their xDS requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata.
      When there is a match, the relevant configuration is made available to
      those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy,
      UrlMap) referenced by the ForwardingRule will not be visible to those
      proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its
      filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
      filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
      metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
      its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the
      metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified, all of them need to
      be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters
      specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap
      that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to
      Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: This field is not used for external load balancing.  For internal
      load balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced
      IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this field is not
      specified, the default network will be used.  For Private Service
      Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network
      must be provided.
    networkTier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this
      load balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and STANDARD.
      For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM.  If this field is
      not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress is specified,
      this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address.
    portRange: When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL,
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and INTERNAL_MANAGED, you can specify a
      port_range. Use with a forwarding rule that points to a target proxy or
      a target pool. Do not use with a forwarding rule that points to a
      backend service. This field is used along with the target field for
      TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy,
      TargetGrpcProxy, TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool, TargetInstance.
      Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
      addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
      Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
      disjoint port ranges.  Some types of forwarding target have constraints
      on the acceptable ports:   - TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080  -
      TargetHttpsProxy: 443  - TargetGrpcProxy: Any ports  - TargetTcpProxy:
      25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1688, 1883, 5222  -
      TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
      1688, 1883, 5222  - TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
    ports: This field is used along with the backend_service field for
      internal load balancing.  When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a
      list of ports can be configured, for example, ['80'], ['8000','9000'].
      Only packets addressed to these ports are forwarded to the backends
      configured with the forwarding rule.  If the forwarding rule's
      loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL, you can specify ports in one of the
      following ways:  * A list of up to five ports, which can be non-
      contiguous * Keyword ALL, which causes the forwarding rule to forward
      traffic on any port of the forwarding rule's protocol.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule
      resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    serviceDirectoryRegistrations: Service Directory resources to register
      this forwarding rule with. Currently, only supports a single Service
      Directory resource.
    serviceLabel: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding
      Rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified
      service name.  The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
      must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
      which cannot be a dash.  This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    serviceName: [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for
      this Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    subnetwork: This field is only used for internal load balancing.  For
      internal load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the
      load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.  If the
      network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
      However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork must be
      specified.
    target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the
      forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a
      global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type
      appropriate to the target object. For more information, see the "Target"
      column in [Port specifications](/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-
      concepts#ip_address_specifications).  For Private Service Connect
      forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name
      of a supported Google API bundle. Currently, the supported Google API
      bundles include:    - vpc-sc - GCP APIs that support VPC Service
      Controls. For more information about which APIs support VPC Service
      Controls, refer to VPC-SC supported products and limitations.   - all-
      apis - All GCP APIs. For more information about which APIs are supported
      with this bundle, refer to Private Google Access-specific domains and
      VIPs.

      suffixed with -shadow. Not supported when the URL map is bound to target
      gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    retryPolicy: Specifies the retry policy associated with this route. Not
      supported when the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    timeout: Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed
      from the time the request has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream)
      up until the response has been completely processed. Timeout includes
      all retries. If not specified, will use the largest timeout among all

    urlRewrite: The spec to modify the URL of the request, prior to forwarding
      the request to the matched service. urlRewrite is the only action
      supported in UrlMaps for external HTTP(S) load balancers. Not supported
      when the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    weightedBackendServices: A list of weighted backend services to send
      traffic to when a route match occurs. The weights determine the fraction
      of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service. If all
      traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one
      weightedBackendService with weight set to a non-zero number. Once a
      backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to the
      backend service, advanced routing actions such as URL rewrites and
      header transformations are applied depending on additional settings
      specified in this HttpRouteAction.

      specified here are applied before the matching
      pathMatchers[].headerAction and after pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeA

      their loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field
      set to true.
    httpFilterConfigs: Outbound route specific configuration for
      networkservices.HttpFilter resources enabled by Traffic Director.
      httpFilterConfigs only applies for Loadbalancers with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule for

      type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Struct  Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field
      set to true.
    matchRules: The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to
      this routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this
      routeRule when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However predicates
      within a given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates within a
      matchRule must match for the request to match the rule.
    priority: For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines
      the order in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules
      are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number.
      The priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1).
      The first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot configure
      two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule
      must be set to a number between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive. Priority
      numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the
      future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which you could
      add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future
      without any impact on existing rules.
    routeAction: In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer
      performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header
      transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected
      backend. If  routeAction specifies any  weightedBackendServices, service
      must not be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot
      contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect, service
      or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. UrlMaps for external
      HTTP(S) load balancers support only the urlRewrite action within a
      routeRule's routeAction.
    service: The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is
      additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc.
      take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if
      service is specified, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of
      urlRedirect, service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    urlRedirect: When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or
      routeAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound to

      PROACTIVE (default): The group attempts to maintain an even distribution
      of VM instances across zones in the region.  - NONE: For non-autoscaled
      groups, proactive redistribution is disabled.
    MinimalActionValueValuesEnum: Minimal action to be taken on an instance.
      You can specify either RESTART to restart existing instances or REPLACE
      to delete and create new instances from the target template. If you
      specify a RESTART, the Updater will attempt to perform that action only.
      However, if the Updater determines that the minimal action you specify
      is not enough to perform the update, it might perform a more disruptive
      action.
    ReplacementMethodValueValuesEnum: What action should be used to replace
      instances. See minimal_action.REPLACE
    TypeValueValuesEnum: The type of update process. You can specify either
      PROACTIVE so that the instance group manager proactively executes
      actions in order to bring instances to their target versions or
      OPPORTUNISTIC so that no action is proactively executed but the update

      regional managed instance groups. Valid values are:   - PROACTIVE
      (default): The group attempts to maintain an even distribution of VM
      instances across zones in the region.  - NONE: For non-autoscaled
      groups, proactive redistribution is disabled.
    maxSurge: The maximum number of instances that can be created above the
      specified targetSize during the update process. By default, a fixed
      value of 1 is used. This value can be either a fixed number or a
      percentage if the instance group has 10 or more instances. If you set a
      percentage, the number of instances will be rounded up if necessary.  At
      least one of either maxSurge or maxUnavailable must be greater than 0.
      Learn more about maxSurge.
    maxUnavailable: The maximum number of instances that can be unavailable
      during the update process. An instance is considered available if all of
      the following conditions are satisfied:    - The instance's status is
      RUNNING.  - If there is a health check on the instance group, the
      instance's liveness health check result must be HEALTHY at least once.
      If there is no health check on the group, then the instance only needs
      to have a status of RUNNING to be considered available.  By default, a
      fixed value of 1 is used. This value can be either a fixed number or a
      percentage if the instance group has 10 or more instances. If you set a
      percentage, the number of instances will be rounded up if necessary.  At

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the

      number of times the host has been ejected. Defaults to 30000ms or 30s.
    consecutiveErrors: Number of errors before a host is ejected from the
      connection pool. When the backend host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx
      return code qualifies as an error. Defaults to 5.
    consecutiveGatewayFailure: The number of consecutive gateway failures
      (502, 503, 504 status or connection errors that are mapped to one of
      those status codes) before a consecutive gateway failure ejection
      occurs. Defaults to 3.
    enforcingConsecutiveErrors: The percentage chance that a host will be

      5xx. This setting can be used to disable ejection or to ramp it up
      slowly. Defaults to 0.

      consecutive gateway failures. This setting can be used to disable
      ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
    enforcingSuccessRate: The percentage chance that a host will be actually
      ejected when an outlier status is detected through success rate
      statistics. This setting can be used to disable ejection or to ramp it
      up slowly. Defaults to 100.
    interval: Time interval between ejection analysis sweeps. This can result
      in both new ejections as well as hosts being returned to service.
      Defaults to 1 second.
    maxEjectionPercent: Maximum percentage of hosts in the load balancing pool
      for the backend service that can be ejected. Defaults to 50%.
    successRateMinimumHosts: The number of hosts in a cluster that must have
      enough request volume to detect success rate outliers. If the number of
      hosts is less than this setting, outlier detection via success rate
      statistics is not performed for any host in the cluster. Defaults to 5.

      be collected in one interval (as defined by the interval duration above)
      to include this host in success rate based outlier detection. If the
      volume is lower than this setting, outlier detection via success rate
      statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults to 100.
    successRateStdevFactor: This factor is used to determine the ejection
      threshold for success rate outlier ejection. The ejection threshold is
      the difference between the mean success rate, and the product of this
      factor and the standard deviation of the mean success rate: mean -
      (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided by a

      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: Specifies the mirrored VPC network. Only packets in this network
      will be mirrored. All mirrored VMs should have a NIC in the given
      network. All mirrored subnetworks should belong to the given network.
    priority: The priority of applying this configuration. Priority is used to
      break ties in cases where there is more than one matching rule. In the
      case of two rules that apply for a given Instance, the one with the
      lowest-numbered priority value wins.  Default value is 1000. Valid range

  Fields:
    defaultRouteAction: defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the
      pathRules or routeRules match. The load balancer performs advanced
      routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to
      forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction
      specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set.
      Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain
      any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or
      defaultUrlRedirect must be set. UrlMaps for external HTTP(S) load
      balancers support only the urlRewrite action within a pathMatcher's
      defaultRouteAction.
    defaultService: The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource.
      This will be used if none of the pathRules or routeRules defined by this
      PathMatcher are matched. For example, the following are all valid URLs
      to a BackendService resource:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/
      projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService  -
      compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService  -
      global/backendServices/backendService  If defaultRouteAction is
      additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc.
      take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if
      defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified. Only one
      of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect  or
      defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. Authorization
      requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the
      specified resource default_service:   - compute.backendBuckets.use  -
      compute.backendServices.use
    defaultUrlRedirect: When none of the specified pathRules or routeRules
      match, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
      defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService
      or defaultRouteAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is
      bound to target gRPC proxy.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    headerAction: Specifies changes to request and response headers that need
      to take effect for the selected backendService. HeaderAction specified
      here are applied after the matching HttpRouteRule HeaderAction and
      before the HeaderAction in the UrlMap  Note that headerAction is not

      that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    name: The name to which this PathMatcher is referred by the HostRule.
    pathRules: The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules
      when routing based on simple path matching is all that's required. The
      order by which path rules are specified does not matter. Matches are
      always done on the longest-path-first basis. For example: a pathRule
      with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/* irrespective of the order
      in which those paths appear in this list. Within a given pathMatcher,
      only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.
    routeRules: The list of HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of
      pathRules when advanced route matching and routing actions are desired.
      routeRules are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.    A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  For some types of
  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies).  **JSON example:**  { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }  **YAML example:**  bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    iamOwned:
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.  To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

  {$api_version}.subnetworks ==)

  Enums:
    PrivateIpv6GoogleAccessValueValuesEnum: The private IPv6 google access
      type for the VMs in this subnet. This is an expanded field of
      enablePrivateV6Access. If both fields are set, privateIpv6GoogleAccess
      will take priority.  This field can be both set at resource creation
      time and updated using patch.
    PurposeValueValuesEnum: The purpose of the resource. This field can be
      either PRIVATE_RFC_1918 or INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. A subnetwork
      with purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created
      subnetwork that is reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. If
      unspecified, the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918. The
      enableFlowLogs field isn't supported with the purpose field set to
      INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
    RoleValueValuesEnum: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only
      used when purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set
      to ACTIVE or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being
      used for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one
      that is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This
      field can be updated with a patch request.
    StateValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The state of the subnetwork, which can
      be one of READY or DRAINING. A subnetwork that is READY is ready to be
      used. The state of DRAINING is only applicable to subnetworks that have
      the purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and indicates that
      connections to the load balancer are being drained. A subnetwork that is
      draining cannot be used or modified until it reaches a status of READY.

  Fields:
    allowSubnetCidrRoutesOverlap: Whether this subnetwork can conflict with
      static routes. Setting this to true allows this subnetwork's primary and
      secondary ranges to conflict with routes that have already been
      configured on the corresponding network. Static routes will take
      precedence over the subnetwork route if the route prefix length is at
      least as large as the subnetwork prefix length.  Also, packets destined
      to IPs within subnetwork may contain private/sensitive data and are
      prevented from leaving the virtual network. Setting this field to true
      will disable this feature.  The default value is false and applies to
      all existing subnetworks and automatically created subnetworks.  This
      field cannot be set to true at resource creation time.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource. This field can be set only at
      resource creation time.
    enableFlowLogs: Whether to enable flow logging for this subnetwork. If
      this field is not explicitly set, it will not appear in get listings. If
      not set the default behavior is to disable flow logging. This field
      isn't supported with the purpose field set to
      INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a Subnetwork. An up-to-date fingerprint
      must be provided in order to update the Subnetwork, otherwise the
      request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.  To see the latest
      fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a Subnetwork.
    gatewayAddress: [Output Only] The gateway address for default routes to
      reach destination addresses outside this subnetwork.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ipCidrRange: The range of internal addresses that are owned by this
      subnetwork. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For
      example, 10.0.0.0/8 or 100.64.0.0/10. Ranges must be unique and non-
      overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported. This field is set
      at resource creation time. This may be a RFC 1918 IP range, or a
      privately routed, non-RFC 1918 IP range, not belonging to Google. The
      range can be expanded after creation using expandIpCidrRange.
    ipv6CidrRange: [Output Only] The range of internal IPv6 addresses that are
      owned by this subnetwork.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#subnetwork for
      Subnetwork resources.
    logConfig: This field denotes the VPC flow logging options for this
      subnetwork. If logging is enabled, logs are exported to Cloud Logging.
    name: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially
      creating the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
      match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means
      the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    network: The URL of the network to which this subnetwork belongs, provided
      by the client when initially creating the subnetwork. Only networks that
      are in the distributed mode can have subnetworks. This field can be set
      only at resource creation time.
    privateIpGoogleAccess: Whether the VMs in this subnet can access Google
      services without assigned external IP addresses. This field can be both
      set at resource creation time and updated using
      setPrivateIpGoogleAccess.
    privateIpv6GoogleAccess: The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs
      in this subnet. This is an expanded field of enablePrivateV6Access. If
      both fields are set, privateIpv6GoogleAccess will take priority.  This
      field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
    purpose: The purpose of the resource. This field can be either
      PRIVATE_RFC_1918 or INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. A subnetwork with
      purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created subnetwork
      that is reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. If unspecified,
      the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918. The enableFlowLogs field isn't
      supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
    region: URL of the region where the Subnetwork resides. This field can be
      set only at resource creation time.
    role: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only used when
      purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set to ACTIVE
      or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for
      Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is
      ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This field can
      be updated with a patch request.
    secondaryIpRanges: An array of configurations for secondary IP ranges for
      VM instances contained in this subnetwork. The primary IP of such VM
      must belong to the primary ipCidrRange of the subnetwork. The alias IPs
      may belong to either primary or secondary ranges. This field can be
      updated with a patch request.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    state: [Output Only] The state of the subnetwork, which can be one of
      READY or DRAINING. A subnetwork that is READY is ready to be used. The
      state of DRAINING is only applicable to subnetworks that have the
      purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and indicates that
      connections to the load balancer are being drained. A subnetwork that is
      draining cannot be used or modified until it reaches a status of READY.

  targetHttpProxies are used by external HTTP load balancers and Traffic
  Director. * regionTargetHttpProxies are used by internal HTTP load
  balancers.  Forwarding rules reference a target HTTP proxy, and the target
  proxy then references a URL map. For more information, read Using Target
  Proxies and  Forwarding rule concepts. (== resource_for

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text

    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a TargetHttpProxy. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to patch/update the
      TargetHttpProxy; otherwise, the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve the TargetHttpProxy.
    httpFilters: URLs to networkservices.HttpFilter resources enabled for xDS
      clients using this configuration. For example, https://networkservices.g
      oogleapis.com/v1alpha1/projects/project/locations/locationhttpFilters/ht
      tpFilter Only filters that handle outbound connection and stream events
      may be specified. These filters work in conjunction with a default set
      of HTTP filters that may already be configured by Traffic Director.
      Traffic Director will determine the final location of these filters
      within xDS configuration based on the name of the HTTP filter. If
      Traffic Director positions multiple filters at the same location, those
      filters will be in the same order as specified in this list. httpFilters
      only applies for loadbalancers with loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule for more details.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpProxy for
      target HTTP proxies.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    proxyBind: This field only applies when the forwarding rule that
      references this target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.  When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies
      set up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port
      specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using
      Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in
      other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound
      requests and handles requests when it receives them.  The default is
      false.

  Enums:
    QuicOverrideValueValuesEnum: Specifies the QUIC override policy for this

      balancer attempts to negotiate QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE,
      ENABLE, or DISABLE.   - When quic-override is set to NONE, Google
      manages whether QUIC is used.  - When quic-override is set to ENABLE,
      the load balancer uses QUIC when possible.  - When quic-override is set
      to DISABLE, the load balancer doesn't use QUIC.  - If the quic-override
      flag is not specified, NONE is implied. -

  Fields:
    authentication: [Deprecated] Use serverTlsPolicy instead.
    authorization: [Deprecated] Use authorizationPolicy instead.
    authorizationPolicy: Optional. A URL referring to a
      networksecurity.AuthorizationPolicy resource that describes how the
      proxy should authorize inbound traffic. If left blank, access will not
      be restricted by an authorization policy. Refer to the
      AuthorizationPolicy resource for additional details. authorizationPolicy
      only applies to a global TargetHttpsProxy attached to
      globalForwardingRules with the loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. Note: This field currently has no impact.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    httpFilters: URLs to networkservices.HttpFilter resources enabled for xDS
      clients using this configuration. For example, https://networkservices.g
      oogleapis.com/beta/projects/project/locations/locationhttpFilters/httpFi
      lter Only filters that handle outbound connection and stream events may
      be specified. These filters work in conjunction with a default set of
      HTTP filters that may already be configured by Traffic Director. Traffic
      Director will determine the final location of these filters within xDS
      configuration based on the name of the HTTP filter. If Traffic Director
      positions multiple filters at the same location, those filters will be
      in the same order as specified in this list. httpFilters only applies
      for loadbalancers with loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
      See ForwardingRule for more details.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpsProxy for
      target HTTPS proxies.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    proxyBind: This field only applies when the forwarding rule that
      references this target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.  When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies
      set up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port
      specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using
      Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in
      other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound
      requests and handles requests when it receives them.  The default is
      false.
    quicOverride: Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy
      resource. This setting determines whether the load balancer attempts to
      negotiate QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE.
      - When quic-override is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is
      used.  - When quic-override is set to ENABLE, the load balancer uses
      QUIC when possible.  - When quic-override is set to DISABLE, the load
      balancer doesn't use QUIC.  - If the quic-override flag is not
      specified, NONE is implied. -
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional
      TargetHttpsProxy resides. This field is not applicable to global
      TargetHttpsProxies.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    serverTlsPolicy: Optional. A URL referring to a
      networksecurity.ServerTlsPolicy resource that describes how the proxy
      should authenticate inbound traffic. serverTlsPolicy only applies to a
      global TargetHttpsProxy attached to globalForwardingRules with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If left blank,
      communications are not encrypted. Note: This field currently has no
      impact.
    sslCertificates: URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to
      authenticate connections between users and the load balancer. At least
      one SSL certificate must be specified. Currently, you may specify up to
      15 SSL certificates.
    sslPolicy: URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the
      TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource has
      no SSL policy configured.
    urlMap: A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that
      defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example, the
      following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map:   -
      https://www.googleapis.compute/v1/projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-

  TCP/UDP load balancing. A target pool references member instances, an
  associated legacy HttpHealthCheck resource, and, optionally, a backup target
  pool. For more information, read Using target pools. (== resource_for
  {$api_version}.targetPools ==)

  Enums:
    SessionAffinityValueValuesEnum: Session affinity option, must be one of
      the following values: NONE: Connections from the same client IP may go
      to any instance in the pool. CLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client
      IP will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains
      healthy. CLIENT_IP_PROTO: Connections from the same client IP with the
      same IP protocol will go to the same instance in the pool while that
      instance remains healthy.

  Fields:
    backupPool: The server-defined URL for the resource. This field is
      applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding
      rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio field is properly set to
      a value between [0, 1].  backupPool and failoverRatio together define
      the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the
      healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below failoverRatio,
      traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup
      pool.  In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all
      the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be
      directed back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic
      will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all
      instances when no instance is healthy.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    failoverRatio: This field is applicable only when the containing target
      pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a
      backup pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be
      in [0, 1].  If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define
      the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the
      healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number,
      traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup
      pool.  In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in
      the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the
      primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the
      healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no
      instance is healthy.
    healthChecks: The URL of the HttpHealthCheck resource. A member instance
      in this pool is considered healthy if and only if the health checks
      pass. An empty list means all member instances will be considered
      healthy at all times. Only legacy HttpHealthChecks are supported. Only
      one health check may be specified.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    instances: A list of resource URLs to the virtual machine instances
      serving this pool. They must live in zones contained in the same region
      as this pool.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetPool for
      target pools.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the target pool resides.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sessionAffinity: Session affinity option, must be one of the following
      values: NONE: Connections from the same client IP may go to any instance

  resources:  * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/urlMaps)
  * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionUrlMaps)  A
  URL map resource is a component of certain types of GCP load balancers and
  Traffic Director.  * urlMaps are used by external HTTP(S) load balancers and
  Traffic Director. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal HTTP(S) load
  balancers.  For a list of supported URL map features by load balancer type,
  see the  Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table.  For
  a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the  Traffic
  Director features: Routing and traffic management table.  This resource
  defines mappings from host names and URL paths to either a backend service
  or a backend bucket.  To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend
  service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or
  INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend
  service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more
  information, read URL Map Concepts.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    defaultRouteAction: defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the
      hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions
      like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
      request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if
      defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or
      defaultUrlRedirect must be set. UrlMaps for external HTTP(S) load
      balancers support only the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction.
      defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to target
      gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    defaultService: The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to
      which traffic is directed if none of the hostRules match. If
      defaultRouteAction is additionally specified, advanced routing actions
      like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the
      backend. However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction
      cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction
      specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified.
      Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect  or
      defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. defaultService
      has no effect when the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    defaultUrlRedirect: When none of the specified hostRules match, the
      request is redirected to a URL specified by defaultUrlRedirect. If
      defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or defaultRouteAction
      must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound to target gRPC
      proxy.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a UrlMap. An up-to-date fingerprint must
      be provided in order to update the UrlMap, otherwise the request will
      fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.  To see the latest fingerprint,
      make a get() request to retrieve a UrlMap.
    headerAction: Specifies changes to request and response headers that need
      to take effect for the selected backendService. The headerAction
      specified here take effect after headerAction specified under
      pathMatcher. Note that headerAction is not supported for Loadbalancers
      that have their loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when
      the URL map is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless
      field set to true.
    hostRules: The list of HostRules to use against the URL.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#urlMaps for url
      maps.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    pathMatchers: The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional URL map
      resides. This field is not applicable to global URL maps. You must
      specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable
      as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    tests: The list of expected URL mapping tests. Request to update this
      UrlMap will succeed only if all of the test cases pass. You can specify
      a maximum of 100 tests per UrlMap. Not supported when the URL map is

    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    detailedStatus: [Output Only] Detailed status message for the VPN tunnel.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ikeVersion: IKE protocol version to use when establishing the VPN tunnel
      with the peer VPN gateway. Acceptable IKE versions are 1 or 2. The
      default version is 2.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#vpnTunnel for VPN
      tunnels.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      VpnTunnel, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet.  To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a VpnTunnel.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    localTrafficSelector: Local traffic selector to use when establishing the
      VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR
      formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges must be
      disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    peerExternalGateway: URL of the peer side external VPN gateway to which
      this VPN tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel
      is created. This field is exclusive with the field peerGcpGateway.
    peerExternalGatewayInterface: The interface ID of the external VPN gateway
      to which this VPN tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the
      VPN tunnel is created.
    peerGcpGateway: URL of the peer side HA GCP VPN gateway to which this VPN
      tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel is
      created. This field can be used when creating highly available VPN from
      VPC network to VPC network, the field is exclusive with the field
      peerExternalGateway. If provided, the VPN tunnel will automatically use
      the same vpnGatewayInterface ID in the peer GCP VPN gateway.
    peerIp: IP address of the peer VPN gateway. Only IPv4 is supported.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the VPN tunnel resides. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    remoteTrafficSelector: Remote traffic selectors to use when establishing
      the VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR
      formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges should be
      disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported.
    router: URL of the router resource to be used for dynamic routing.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sharedSecret: Shared secret used to set the secure session between the
      Cloud VPN gateway and the peer VPN gateway.
    sharedSecretHash: Hash of the shared secret.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the VPN tunnel, which can be one of
      the following:  - PROVISIONING: Resource is being allocated for the VPN
      tunnel.  - WAITING_FOR_FULL_CONFIG: Waiting to receive all VPN-related
      configs from the user. Network, TargetVpnGateway, VpnTunnel,
      ForwardingRule, and Route resources are needed to setup the VPN tunnel.
      - FIRST_HANDSHAKE: Successful first handshake with the peer VPN.  -
      ESTABLISHED: Secure session is successfully established with the peer
      VPN.  - NETWORK_ERROR: Deprecated, replaced by NO_INCOMING_PACKETS  -
      AUTHORIZATION_ERROR: Auth error (for example, bad shared secret).  -
      NEGOTIATION_FAILURE: Handshake failed.  - DEPROVISIONING: Resources are
