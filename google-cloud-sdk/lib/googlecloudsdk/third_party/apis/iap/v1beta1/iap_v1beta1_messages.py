class Binding(_messages.Message):
  r"""Associates `members` with a `role`.

  Fields:
    bindingId: A string attribute.
    condition: The condition that is associated with this binding. If the
      condition evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current
      request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does
      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding
      might grant the same role to one or more of the members in this binding.
      To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see
      the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A
      special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with
      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that
      represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` .
      * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service
      account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. *
      `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For
      example, `admins@example.com`. *
      `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique
      identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For
      example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is
      recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user
      retains the role in the binding. *
      `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address
      (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been
      recently deleted. For example, `my-other-
      app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the
      service account is undeleted, this value reverts to
      `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the
      role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An
      email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that
      has been recently deleted. For example,
      `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is
      recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered
      group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite
      domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For
      example, `google.com` or `example.com`.
    role: Role that is assigned to `members`. For example, `roles/viewer`,
      `roles/editor`, or `roles/owner`.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of
  Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable
  access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression:
  request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= -
  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
