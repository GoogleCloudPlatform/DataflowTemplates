      create a "NodePool" object with an auto-generated name. Do not use this
      and a node_pool at the same time. For responses, this field will be
      populated with the node configuration of the first node pool. (For
      configuration of each node pool, see `node_pool.config`) If unspecified,

      sNAT for this cluster.
    desiredImage: The desired name of the image to use for this node. This is
      used to create clusters using a custom image. NOTE: Set the
      "desired_node_pool" field as well.
    desiredImageProject: The project containing the desired image to use for
      this node. This is used to create clusters using a custom image. NOTE:

    desiredImageType: The desired image type for the node pool. NOTE: Set the
      "desired_node_pool" field as well.
    desiredIntraNodeVisibilityConfig: The desired config of Intra-node
      visibility.
    desiredLocations: The desired list of Google Compute Engine
      [zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones#available) in which
      the cluster's nodes should be located. This list must always include the
      cluster's primary zone. Warning: changing cluster locations will update
      the locations of all node pools and will result in nodes being added
      and/or removed.
    desiredLoggingService: The logging service the cluster should use to write
      logs. Currently available options: * `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`
      - The Cloud Logging service with a Kubernetes-native resource model *
      `logging.googleapis.com` - The legacy Cloud Logging service (no longer
      available as of GKE 1.15). * `none` - no logs will be exported from the
      cluster. If left as an empty string,`logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes`
      will be used for GKE 1.14+ or `logging.googleapis.com` for earlier
      versions.
    desiredMasterAuthorizedNetworksConfig: The desired configuration options
      for master authorized networks feature.
    desiredMasterVersion: The Kubernetes version to change the master to.
      Users may specify either explicit versions offered by Kubernetes Engine
      or version aliases, which have the following behavior: - "latest": picks
      the highest valid Kubernetes version - "1.X": picks the highest valid
      patch+gke.N patch in the 1.X version - "1.X.Y": picks the highest valid
      gke.N patch in the 1.X.Y version - "1.X.Y-gke.N": picks an explicit
      Kubernetes version - "-": picks the default Kubernetes version
    desiredMonitoringService: The monitoring service the cluster should use to
      write metrics. Currently available options: *
      "monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes" - The Cloud Monitoring service
      with a Kubernetes-native resource model * `monitoring.googleapis.com` -
      The legacy Cloud Monitoring service (no longer available as of GKE
      1.15). * `none` - No metrics will be exported from the cluster. If left
      as an empty string,`monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes` will be used
      for GKE 1.14+ or `monitoring.googleapis.com` for earlier versions.
    desiredNodePoolAutoscaling: Autoscaler configuration for the node pool
      specified in desired_node_pool_id. If there is only one pool in the
      cluster and desired_node_pool_id is not provided then the change applies
      to that single node pool.
    desiredNodePoolId: The node pool to be upgraded. This field is mandatory
      if "desired_node_version", "desired_image_family" or
      "desired_node_pool_autoscaling" is specified and there is more than one
      node pool on the cluster.
    desiredNodeVersion: The Kubernetes version to change the nodes to
      (typically an upgrade). Users may specify either explicit versions
      offered by Kubernetes Engine or version aliases, which have the
      following behavior: - "latest": picks the highest valid Kubernetes
      version - "1.X": picks the highest valid patch+gke.N patch in the 1.X
      version - "1.X.Y": picks the highest valid gke.N patch in the 1.X.Y
      version - "1.X.Y-gke.N": picks an explicit Kubernetes version - "-":
