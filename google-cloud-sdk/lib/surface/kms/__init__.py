  """Manage cryptographic keys in the cloud.

  The gcloud kms command group lets you generate, use, rotate and destroy
  Google Cloud KMS keys.

  Cloud KMS is a cloud-hosted key management service that lets you manage
  encryption for your cloud services the same way you do on-premises. You can
  generate, use, rotate and destroy AES256 encryption keys. Cloud KMS is
  integrated with IAM and Cloud Audit Logging so that you can manage
  permissions on individual keys, and monitor how these are used. Use Cloud
  KMS to protect secrets and other sensitive data which you need to store in
  Google Cloud Platform.

  More information on Cloud KMS can be found here:
  https://cloud.google.com/kms/ and detailed documentation can be found here:
  https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/
