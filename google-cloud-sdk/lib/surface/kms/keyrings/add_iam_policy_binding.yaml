    'roles/cloudkms.signer' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on the keyring fellowship and
    location global, run:

      $ {command} fellowship --location='global' --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/cloudkms.signer' --condition='expression=request.time < timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,description=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'
