    - arg_name: labels
      required: true
      help_text: |
        One or more label entries that apply to the Group. Currently supported labels contain a key
        with an empty value.

        Google Groups are the default type of group and have a label with a key of
        'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum' and an empty value.

        Existing Google Groups can have an additional label with a key of
        'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.security' and an empty value added to them.
        *This is an immutable change and the security label cannot be removed once added.*

        Dynamic groups have a label with a key of 'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.dynamic'.

        Identity-mapped groups for Cloud Search have a label with a key of 'system/groups/external'
        and an empty value.

        Examples: {"cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum": ""} or
        {"system/groups/external": ""}.

        The maximum number of results to return.

        Note that the number of results returned may be less than this value even if there are more
        available results. To fetch all results, clients must continue calling this method
        repeatedly until the response no longer contains a nextPageToken.

        If unspecified, defaults to 200 'basic' view and to 50 for 'full' view.

        Must not be greater than 1000 for 'basic' view or 500 for 'full' view.
