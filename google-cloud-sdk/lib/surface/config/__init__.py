  """View and edit Cloud SDK properties.

  The {command} command group lets you set, view and unset properties used by
  Cloud SDK.

  A configuration is a set of properties that govern the behavior of `gcloud`
  and other Cloud SDK tools. The initial `default` configuration is set when
  `gcloud init` is run. You can create additional named configurations using
  `gcloud init` or `{command} configurations create`.

  To display the path of the active configuration along with information
  about the current `gcloud` environment, run $ gcloud info.

  To switch between configurations, use `{command} configurations activate`.

  gcloud supports several flags that have the same effect as properties in
  a configuration (for example, gcloud supports both the `--project` flag and
  `project` property). Properties differ from flags in that flags affect command
  behavior on a per-invocation basis. Properties allow you to maintain the same
  settings across command executions.

  For more information on configurations, see `gcloud topic configurations`.
