  Deletes the project with the given project ID.

  This command can fail for the following reasons:
  * The project specified does not exist.
  * The active account does not have IAM role `role/owner` or another IAM role
    with the `resourcemanager.projects.delete` permission for the given project.

  See [Access control for projects using
  IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-proj) for
  more information.

  ## EXAMPLES

  The following command deletes the project with the ID `example-foo-bar-1`:

    $ {command} example-foo-bar-1
