    brief: Set the IAM policy for a Cloud Pub/Sub Topic.
    description: |
      This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a topic, given a topic
      and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If the
      given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
      succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
      obtained via `get-iam-policy` will prevent the replacement if the policy
      for the topic has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
      contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the topic.
    examples: |
      The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
      'policy.json' and set it for a topic with identifier 'my-topic'

        $ {command} my-topic policy.json

       See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
       policy file format and contents.
