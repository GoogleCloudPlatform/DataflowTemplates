            Cloud SCC specific source. It's derived from the the source's relative resource name.
            See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name.
            For Example: For the given source name: "organizations/123/sources/456", 456 represents
            source id.

          help_text: |
            Source's display name must be unique amongst its siblings, for example, two sources
            with the same parent can't share the same display name.
            Display name must start and end with a letter or digit, may contain letters, digits,
            spaces, hyphens, and underscores, and can be no longer than 32 characters. This is
            captured by the regular expression: [\p{L}\p{N}]({\p{L}\p{N}_- ]{0,30}[\p{L}\p{N}])?.
            For example: 'Cloud Security Scanner' is the source display name.
