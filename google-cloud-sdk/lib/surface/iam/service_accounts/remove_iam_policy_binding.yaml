  brief: Remove IAM policy binding from a service account.
  description: |
    Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a service account. A binding consists of at
    least one member, a role, and an optional condition.

    When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a
    resource or as an identity. This command is to remove a policy binding from
    a service account resource. There are other gcloud commands to manage IAM
    policies for other types of resources. For example, to manage IAM policies
    on a project, use the $ gcloud projects commands.

  examples: |
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user 'test-user@gmail.com'
    on a service account with identifier 'my-iam-account@somedomain.com', run:

      $ {command} my-iam-account@somedomain.com --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor'

    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' from all
    authenticated users on service account 'my-iam-account@somedomain.com', run:

      $ {command} my-iam-account@somedomain.com --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' --role='roles/editor'

    To remove an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2018 for the role of
    'roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin' and the user 'test-user@gmail.com' on a service account with identifier 'my-iam-account@somedomain.com', run:

      $ {command} my-iam-account@somedomain.com --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin' --condition='expression=request.time < timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2018,description=Expires at midnight on 2018-12-31'

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
    policy role and member types.
