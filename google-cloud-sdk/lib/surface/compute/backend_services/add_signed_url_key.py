  """Add Cloud CDN Signed URL key to a backend service.

  *{command}* is used to add a new Cloud CDN Signed URL key to a backend
  service.

  Cloud CDN Signed URLs give you a way to serve responses from the
  globally distributed CDN cache, even if the request needs to be
  authorized.

  Signed URLs are a mechanism to temporarily give a client access to a
  private resource without requiring additional authorization. To achieve
  this, the full request URL that should be allowed is hashed
  and cryptographically signed. By using the signed URL you give it, that
  one request will be considered authorized to receive the requested
  content.

  Generally, a signed URL can be used by anyone who has it. However, it
  is usually only intended to be used by the client that was directly
  given the URL. To mitigate this, they expire at a time chosen by the
  issuer. To minimize the risk of a signed URL being shared, we recommend
  that you set it to expire as soon as possible.

  A 128-bit secret key is used for signing the URLs.
