  # Choosing a Python Interpreter

  The `gcloud` CLI runs under Python. On Windows, you have the option of
  installing a bundled Python interpreter, but on Mac and Linux you must have
  a Python interpreter available somewhere on your system. `gcloud` will
  attempt to locate an interpreter on your system PATH by looking for the
  following binaries:

      * python2
      * python27
      * python
      * python3

  Python 3 is preferred over Python 2. Note that `gcloud` requires Python
  version 2.7.x or 3.5-3.8.

  Other Python tools shipped in the Cloud SDK do not support Python 3 and
  require Python 2.7.x, including:

      * `dev_appserver`
      * `endpointscfg`

  If you have multiple Python interpreters available or if you don't have one
  on your PATH, you can specify which interpreter to use by setting the
  `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON` environment variable. For example:

    # Use the python3 interpreter on your path
    $ export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=python3


    # Use a python you have installed in a special location
    $ export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=/usr/local/my-custom-python-install/python

  gsutil now supports Python 3.5-3.8 in addition to Python 2.7.x. To use a
  different interpreter for gsutil than for the other Python tools, you can set
  the desired interpreter by setting the CLOUDSDK_GSUTIL_PYTHON environment
  variable.

  bq now supports Python 3.5-3.8 in addition to Python 2.7.x. To use a
  different interpreter for bq than for the other Python tools, you can set the
  desired interpreter by setting the CLOUDSDK_BQ_PYTHON environment variable.

  # Configuring the Python Interpreter

  While not typically necessary, you are able to pass interpreter level
  arguments to the Python running `gcloud` via the `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON_ARGS`
  environment variable.

  A common use case for this (which has been special-cased) is to enable
  'site packages'. This allows Python to pick up libraries from the system (
  for example, those that may have been installed with `pip`). Site packages may
  be necessary if you require certain native libraries (as is the case if you
  work with service accounts using a legacy .p12 key, for example). To enable
  site packages, set `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON_SITEPACKAGES=1`. Note that enabling site
  packages may cause conflicts with `gcloud` packaged libraries, depending on
  what you have installed on your system.


  # Setting Configurations and Properties

  Your active configuration can also be set via the environment variable
  `CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME`. This allows you to specify a certain
  configuration in a given terminal session without changing the global
  default configuration.

  In addition to being able to set them via `gcloud config set`,
  each `gcloud` property has a corresponding environment variable. They take
  the form: `CLOUDSDK_SECTION_PROPERTY`. For example, if you wanted to
  change your active project for just one terminal you could run:

    $ export CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=my-project

  For more information, see `gcloud topic configurations`.
